This is the Thebes that Jocasta has known her entire life, a city ruled by a king--her husband-to-be. Jocasta struggles through this miserable marriage until she is unexpectedly widowed--now free to choose her next husband, she selects the handsome, youthful Oedipus. When whispers emerge of an unbearable scandal, the very society that once lent Jocasta its support seems determined to destroy her. Ismene is a girl in mourning, longing for the golden days of her youth--days spent lolling in the courtyard garden, reading and reveling in her parents' happiness and love. Now she is an orphan, and the target of a murder plot, attacked within the very walls of the palace. As the deadly political competition swirls around her, she must uncover the root of the plot - and reveal the truth of the curse that has consumed her family. The novel is based on Oedipus Tyrannus and Antigone , two of Classical Greece's most compelling tragedies. Told in intersecting narratives, this feminist reimagining of Sophocles' classic plays brings life and voice to the women who were too often forced to the background of their own stories. It is compulsively entertaining fiction that recasts these familiar stories for the twenty-first century reader.",

Don\u2019t go into this expecting romance or a happily ever after. This story is a dark thriller about an internet date that goes very wrong. I thought it was well written and well paced and the characters interesting. It even had a nice little twist at the end.

This book is part of that 2010 collection. It is maintained in a data base structure to provide the highest information density. Each marriage is contained in one line. Each party in the union is included in the alphabetical listing. Using the records in a database format and listing both participants in the alphabetical sort was so unique in 1960 that the U.S. Government has granted Hunting For Bears a (c)copyright on the presentation in both electronic and print format.\r\n\r\nWhen available, record location information such as county book and page number may be included as well as age, birth or death dates, race, gender and information about prior marriages. \r\n\r\nSeveral things we are considering in the immediate future are; e_books to buy, loan or free downloads, books available through instant publication, and books on line.\r\n\r\nOh, the name and logo, Russell, as Nick was called in his youth, loved puns. The newspaper genealogy column that he began writing in 1951, Hunting Your Forebears, quickly became Hunting For Bears and the bear and hunter logo was created.",

        "publicationYear":2019,
        "description":"A critical examination of the history of US-Palestinian relations The United States has invested billions of dollars and countless diplomatic hours in the pursuit of Israeli-Palestinian peace and a two-state solution. Yet American attempts to broker an end to the conflict have repeatedly come up short. At the center of these failures lay two critical factors: Israeli power and Palestinian politics. While both Israelis and Palestinians undoubtedly share much of the blame, one also cannot escape the role of the United States, as the sole mediator in the process, in these repeated failures. American peacemaking efforts ultimately ran aground as a result of Washington's unwillingness to confront Israel's ever-deepening occupation or to come to grips with the realities of internal Palestinian politics. In particular, the book looks at the interplay between the U.S.-led peace process and internal Palestinian politics--namely, how a badly flawed peace process helped to weaken Palestinian leaders and institutions and how an increasingly dysfunctional Palestinian leadership, in turn, hindered prospects for a diplomatic resolution. Thus, while the peace process was not necessarily doomed to fail, Washington's management of the process, with its built-in blind spot to Israeli power and Palestinian politics, made failure far more likely than a negotiated breakthrough. Shaped by the pressures of American domestic politics and the special relationship with Israel, Washington's distinctive \"blind spot\" to Israeli power and Palestinian politics has deep historical roots, dating back to the 1917 Balfour Declaration and the British Mandate. The size of the blind spot has varied over the years and from one administration to another, but it is always present.",

When a young woman emerges from a lengthy coma-like state she must face the decisions that were made about her body--without her consent--in this powerful novel of reclamation and hope. Twenty-one-year-old Mallie Williams--scrappy, headstrong, and wise beyond her years--has just landed on her feet following a tumultuous youth when the unthinkable happens: she is violently assaulted. The crime leaves her comatose, surrounded by friends and family who are hoping against hopes for a full recovery. But soon Mallie's small community finds themselves divided. The rape has left Mallie pregnant, and while some friends are convinced that she would never keep the pregnancy, others are sure that a baby would be the only good thing to come out of all of this pain. Who gets to decide? How much power, in the end, do we have over our own bodies? Mallie, her family, and her town find themselves at the center of a media storm, confronting questions nobody should have to face. And when Mallieemerges from the fog, what will she think of the choices that were made on her behalf? The Opposite of Fate is an intense and moving exploration of the decisions we make--and don't make--that forever change the course of our lives.",

It was a pretty well-rounded book for being on the shorter side page wise. It was well written and nicely paced. It was very insta-everything. It had no OW\/OM drama. No angst. Some hot sex scenes ( a couple of daddies, spanking, etc. ). A couple of interesting side characters. A very sexy and very alpha hero who was all in from the start and a very likable and sweet heroine. All wrapped up in a nice little epilogue.<br \/><br \/>Not much more to say really.

First published in the 1970s, it is now more relevant to today\u2019s overcrowded planet than ever. With an introduction by Iain Sinclair. In the city we can live deliberately: inventing and renewing ourselves, carving out journeys, creating private spaces. But in the city we are also afraid of being alone, clinging to the structures of daily life to ward off the chaos around us. How is it that the noisy, jostling, overwhelming metropolis leaves us at once so energized and so fragile? In Soft City, Jonathan Raban, one of our most acclaimed novelists and travel writers seeks to find out. 'A psychological handbook for urban survival' \u2013 Sunday Telegraph",

Great composition. <br \/><br \/>Oh man I do not even know where to start with this book. The first 85% of this one was good. It was pretty well written. The pace was fine. The heroine was a bit hard to warm up to. She was a judgy bitch for the first 40%, but she did get better after that. I liked Dominic even if his speech was a little on the flowery side at times. The mystery aspect was interesting as well.<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><b>BUT<\/b> and it is a massive but, at 70% I started to get an inkling where this one was going, and I said a little prayer to the romance gods that I was wrong. Unfortunately, at 85% my fears were realized, and the wheels fell WAY off the damn bus. What followed was a gag worthy trope that I LOATHE with a passion and more OTT soap opera like drama to fill 25 seasons. Obviously, I can\u2019t expound of what that twist was without giving away a HUGE spoiler, but suffice it to say it was on the extreme end.<br \/><br \/>Which leaves me in a quandary. If I enjoyed most of the book but the last 15% destroyed all that enjoyment what is a fair rating? I am going to set it at 3-Stars for now and give myself more time to ponder on it.<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>",

The brown ppl are made of stone and rock. I like how  Dittemore created the fantasy origin myth. . This book is about colonization. How the native people helped a marooned foreign royal but she betrayed them and caused a forever winter. It\u2019s about the exploited coal miners and native population starting a rebellion against The Majority.  Our protag is an orphan who influences and mentally talks to winter. She\u2019s not human but has pale skin. Imagine Elsa. She\u2019s a bad bitch driving a magically enhanced ice road truck. She\u2019s a loner type but gradually cares for the ragtag group she unwillingly goes in a bargain with. <br \/><br \/>I docked stars because I found that some parts of the worldbuilding did not mesh with other parts.

        "description":"From the acclaimed author of A Good Family comes a timely spin on Sense and Sensibility, a twenty-first-century family drama featuring two half-Korean sisters, their ex-hippie mother, multiple messy love affairs and one explosive secret that could ruin everything. Amelia Bae-Wood's life is falling apart. Unemployed, newly single and completely broke--for reasons she hasn't told anyone yet--she finds herself hitchhiking across California to deal with the fallout of her mother's eviction from the family estate. Amelia needs somewhere to live and time to figure out what to do with the rest of her life, so moving with her mother and sister to Arcadia, the cancer retreat center where her sister volunteers, seems like as good an idea as any. Amelia's sister, Eleanor, has too much on her plate, including being caught up in a court battle with a man who claims to be their half brother from Seoul and their late father's only son--a secret love child from his Korean youth--who's fighting for a piece of everything that belongs to the Bae-Wood women. And when Amelia adds herself to Eleanor's list of problems, Eleanor must figure out what to hold on to--and when to let go--before things starts to unravel. A witty, wry and enormously entertaining retelling, the sisters' journey of self-discovery as they reshape their lives gives this classic tale a modern, feminist twist, as it touches on themes of blended families, race, class and wealth.",

Every now and again I need to get down here, to get into the Diogenes tub, as it were, or the Colmcille beehive hut, or the Mossbawn scullery. At any rate, a hedge surrounds me, the blackbird calls, the soul settles for an hour or two. In this astute selection from Seamus Heaney\u2019s vast correspondence, we are given direct access to the life and poetic development of a literary titan, from his early days in Belfast, through his controversial decision to settle in the Republic, to the gradual broadening of horizons that culminated in the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the years of international eminence that kept him heroically busy until his death. Christopher Reid draws from both public and private archives to reveal this remarkable story in the poet\u2019s own words. Generous, funny, exuberant, confiding, irreverent, empathetic, and deeply thoughtful, The Letters of Seamus Heaney encompasses decades-long relationships with friends and colleagues, as well as an unstinted responsiveness to passing acquaintances. Heaney\u2019s mastery of language is as evident here as it is in any of his writings; listening to his voice we find ourselves in the same room as a man whose presence enriched the world and whose legacy deepens our sense of what truly matters.",

The investigators have no reliable evidence, so Max's parents have no certainty and are unable to say goodbye to their son. Everything changes when one investigator makes an unbelievable offer: he can have Max's father placed in the psychiatric prison hospital where Guido T is imprisoned \u2013 as a fake patient. Max's father agrees. He plans to force the child killer into a confession. Because nothing is worse than uncertainty. Or so he thinks. Until he, as an inmate, learns the gruesome truth...

        "description":"At fourteen Ian Manuel was sentenced to life without parole. My Time Will Come is a paean to the capacity of the human will to transcend adversity through determination and art. \"Ian is magic. His story is difficult and heartbreaking, but he takes us places we need to go to understand why we must do better.\" --Bryan Stevenson, author of Just Mercy \"My story has been told many times and by highly regarded experts in their fields--judges, prosecutors, juvenile probation officers, sociologists, journalists. But I would like to try to tell it to you myself. I have reason to believe the experts may be wrong about me. You see, today, thirty years later, I am neither in prison nor dead.\" --from My Time Will Come The United States is the only country in the world that sentences thirteen- and fourteen-year-old offenders, mostly youth of color, to life in prison without parole, regardless of the scientifically proven singularities of the developing adolescent brain--a heinous wrinkle in the scandal of mass incarceration. In a botched mugging attempt with some older boys, Ian Manuel, then fourteen, shot Debbie Baigrie, a young white mother of two, in the face. But as Bryan Stevenson has insisted, none of us should be judged only by the worst thing we have ever done. Capturing the fullness of his humanity, here is Manuel's powerful testimony of growing up homeless in Central Park Village in Tampa, Florida--a neighborhood riddled with poverty, gang violence, and drug abuse--and of his efforts to rise above his circumstances, only to find himself, partly through his own actions, imprisoned for two-thirds of his life, eighteen years of which were spent in solitary confinement. Here is the at once wrenching and inspiring story of how he endured the savagery of the United States prison system and of how his victim, an extraordinary woman, forgave him and bravely advocated for his freedom, which was achieved by a crusade on the part of the Equal Justice Initiative to address the barbarism of our judicial system and to bring about \"just mercy.\" Full of unexpected twists and turns as it describes a struggle to attain the glory of redemption, My Time Will Come is a testament to Ian's resolve to rise above injustice through his dedication to writing poetry.",

                "comment":"<p>Originally published on Unravellations.<br \/><br \/>It was all right. I skipped over some pages with what I found to be unnecessary details. Not sure if I\u2019m just an impatient mystery reader or if I\u2019m just not used to Wentworth\u2019s style of writing. I\u2019ve been reading tons of Agatha Christie before, so while there are elements of similarity, the narrative style and plot structure are significantly different.<br \/><br \/>The mystery in itself was somewhat interesting. I agreed with the main character Hilary when she said, \u201cToo many alibis all over the place\u201d. A man is shot ostensibly by his favourite nephew, the case is closed and said nephew has already served his jail sentence for a year before the action of the novel begins. I found that the details of the mystery was repeated just a tad too much, though. I get that things have to be clarified and details emphasized for the reader (also so they might have a go at picking out fishy loopholes for themselves), but I found myself skipping pages because the repetitions were getting tedious and boring.<br \/><br \/>Regarding the characters, we have Hilary, who is this nephew\u2019s cousin-in-law, and her on-and-off-again fiance Henry Cunningham, are the main characters. Hilary and Henry\u2019s relationship dynamics tended toward a chauvinist male and trying-to-be-spunky-but-failing female which was a common enough trope in the 1940s, but it wasn\u2019t overly irritating to me. I particularly remember a line where Wentworth described Hilary as having flashes of thoughts about the inquest: <i>\u201cThere was of course no logic in this, but Hilary had not a very logical mind.\u201d<\/i> Couple this with the fact that Hilary is impulsive and reckless, apparently heedless of potential dangerous situations, constantly getting herself into scrapes, and then generally requiring the assistance of her man, Henry, to get her back to safety\u2026 I guess I shouldn\u2019t expect much more from a novel from the 40\u2019s.<br \/><br \/>Miss Silver only appears in the middle of the book. While Christie\u2019s detectives tend to have some point of interest or memorable quirk that engages me and gives me a pleasant pattern to look forward to in future stories, Miss Silver appears to have none of these. I don\u2019t mean to say that Christie\u2019s detectives are the only allowable type of detective characters, but I found nothing about Miss Silver to engage me or make me interested in reading more of her cases. The plot and action really revolves around the main characters, who certainly won\u2019t be recurring in other novels and therefore also give me no reason for me to continue.<br \/><br \/>My review sounds unfavourable so far, but the book redeemed itself in enough moments of suspense and excitement. The plot twists were somewhat good, though few in number. Though some points about the two main characters chafed me, it wasn\u2019t to the point where I found them outright annoying and difficult to swallow. Miss Silver was almost a non-entity besides providing an input for plot twists, so while she made little impression on me, she didn\u2019t annoy me either. I\u2019m not sure whether I will continue to read more Miss Silver stories, I would recommend this book for those who love mystery stories from this era.<\/p>",

        "description":"The specter of polygamy haunts Mormonism. More than a century after the practice was banned, it casts a long shadow that obscures people's perceptions of the lives of today's Latter-day Saint women. Many still see them as second-class citizens, oppressed by the church and their husbands, and forced to stay home and take care of their many children. Sister Saints offers a history of modern Mormon women that takes aim at these stereotypes, showing that their stories are much more complex than previously thought. Women in the Utah territory received the right to vote in 1870-fifty years before the nineteenth amendment-only to have it taken away by the same federal legislation that forced the end of polygamy. Progressive and politically active, Mormon women had a profound impact on public life in the first few decades of the twentieth century. They then turned inward, creating a domestic ideal that shaped Mormon culture for generations. The women's movement of the 1970s sparked a new, vigorous-and hotly contested-Mormon feminism that divided Latter-day Saint women. By the twenty-first century more than half of all Mormons lived outside the United States, and what had once been a small community of pioneer women had grown into a diverse global sisterhood. Colleen McDannell argues that we are on the verge of an era in which women are likely to play a greater role in the Mormon church. Well-educated, outspoken, and deeply committed to their faith, these women are defying labels like liberal and conservative, traditional and modern. This deeply researched and eye-opening book ranges over more than a century of history to tell the stories of extraordinary-and ordinary-Latter-day Saint women with empathy and narrative flair.",

Attractive and eye-catching title work. Five lick worthy stars for sure! <br \/><br \/>I love these two author\u2019s writing. I love this group of men, and I loved this book. It was SO close to being a 5-Star read for me. As I said, the writing was excellent. The pace was fantastic. It had an interesting plot that kept me glued to the pages. There was no OW\/OM drama. Some smokin\u2019 hot sex scenes. A fabulous cast of secondary characters. An extremely likable and sexy alpha hero and a heroine that was the reason this lost some starage. All wrapped up in one HELL of a cliffhanger. I SO need book two NOW.<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>I am going to be straight up honest and admit I am SUPER friggin picky with my heroines. There is a fine line between feisty and being a bitch. As there is with being independent and being stupid. Unfortunately for the first half of this book, I found JJ crossed over into the annoying side for me. Was her and Jonas\u2019s banter great at times? Indeed it was. Was her snapping bitchily at him one too many times cute? No, it was not. While I understood her wanting to keep her past private for awhile. Once things started to happen her continued refusal to tell anyone about it came across as extremely stupid and to be honest selfish. So yes I did struggle with her at times and that ultimately had me lowering my rating a bit. All in all, though I did enjoy this one and am looking forward to book two and what this author has in store for us next.<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>",

        "description":"In 1177 B.C., marauding groups known only as the \"Sea Peoples\" invaded Egypt. The pharaoh\u2019s army and navy managed to defeat them, but the victory so weakened Egypt that it soon slid into decline, as did most of the surrounding civilizations. After centuries of brilliance, the civilized world of the Bronze Age came to an abrupt and cataclysmic end. Kingdoms fell like dominoes over the course of just a few decades. No more Minoans or Mycenaeans. No more Trojans, Hittites, or Babylonians. The thriving economy and cultures of the late second millennium B.C., which had stretched from Greece to Egypt and Mesopotamia, suddenly ceased to exist, along with writing systems, technology, and monumental architecture. But the Sea Peoples alone could not have caused such widespread breakdown. How did it happen? In this major new account of the causes of this \"First Dark Ages,\" Eric Cline tells the gripping story of how the end was brought about by multiple interconnected failures, ranging from invasion and revolt to earthquakes, drought, and the cutting of international trade routes. Bringing to life the vibrant multicultural world of these great civilizations, he draws a sweeping panorama of the empires and globalized peoples of the Late Bronze Age and shows that it was their very interdependence that hastened their dramatic collapse and ushered in a dark age that lasted centuries. A compelling combination of narrative and the latest scholarship, 1177 B.C. sheds new light on the complex ties that gave rise to, and ultimately destroyed, the flourishing civilizations of the Late Bronze Age -- and that set the stage for the emergence of classical Greece. - Publisher.",

        "description":"The Wrong Kind of Muslim is a call to unite those of all faiths and of no faith in the struggle for universal freedom of conscience. Since 9\/11, terrorists in Pakistan have killed over 40,000-and counting. Often risking his life, Qasim Rashid journeys into the heart of that terrorism to unearth the untold story of those silenced by Taliban suicide bombings, secret police torture, and state sponsored religious persecution. Rashid exposes the horrifying truth about growing radicalism in Pakistan and its impact on Western security. But most importantly, Rashid uncovers the inspiring untold story of millions fighting back-and winning. EDITORIAL REVIEWS & CRITICAL ACCLAIM \"A heartfelt memoir of Muslim-on-Muslim discrimination and oppression. A harrowing yet hopeful story of modern-day religious persecution.\" - Kirkus Reviews. The Wrong Kind of Muslim is the Recipient of the Kirkus Star, Awarded to Books of Exceptional Merit \"In his adopted home of America, Qasim Rashid has experienced stereotyping and discrimination as a Pakistani-born Muslim. In his native home of Pakistan, Rashid and his family are subject to persecution because their Ahmadi Muslim faith is considered heretical by many in the Sunni Muslim majority. Rashid's heartfelt story compels admiration for him and a deeper appreciation for America's guarantee of religious freedom.\" The Honorable TIM KAINE, United States Senator \"The Wrong Kind of Muslim is a significant and alarming book. It tells the story of growing religious intolerance in Pakistan, a nation profoundly important to American security, where the acceptable bounds of faith have become ever tighter in recent years. Victims of persecution have included Christians and Hindus, but also Muslim believers whom Islamists deem heretical. The book demands attention as a passionate call for peace and wide-ranging toleration.\" Baylor University Distinguished Professor of History DR. PHILIP JENKINS, Author of Images of Terror: What We Can And Can't Know About Terrorism and recognized by The Economist as \"one of America's best scholars of religion\" \"The Wrong Kind of Muslim is a young American's personal journey into his heritage and religion as a vehicle into the history and ongoing phenomenon of faith-based persecution and target-killings in Pakistan - starting with a childhood bullying incident in Chicago. A compelling account, often painful, sometimes uplifting, told with honesty and humor. A must-read for anyone who cares about human rights, humanity, freedom of expression, thought and conscience, not just in Pakistan but anywhere in the world.\" Pakistani Journalist and Film Maker BEENA SARWAR, Former Fellow at Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at Harvard \"The Wrong Kind of Muslim is an inspiring book that should be in every high school and college classroom around the world. It educates and motivates its readers, whether in the East or in the West, on how to overcome ignorance and extremism peacefully-even in the face of bitter persecution.\" President & CEO, Silicon Valley Education Foundation, MUHAMMED AHMAD CHAUDHRY, Leading Education Advocate \"In one word, heroic.\" USA President Ahmadiyya Muslim Youth Association, DR.

That said I really like the bottom half with the snowflakes. <br \/><br \/><br \/>This is the second book that I have read by this author and again I greatly enjoyed it. It was well-written and nicely paced. The DD\/lg kink was a little deeper (for lack of a better word) in this one. Coloring books, stuffed animals and dressing up. Again no epilogue, but I knew that going in, so I was alright with it.<br \/><br \/>It took me a bit to warm up to Brook. She came across a little too self-centered and lazy in my opinion. I would have liked to have seen her have to go back and pay back the people she ripped off, but OK, that wasn\u2019t really the point of the book. Berk was an interesting DD. I enjoyed him, but I would have liked to seen them spend more time together. He always seemed to be off for business. Two-three weeks at a time. His character (and the story as a whole) felt a little underdeveloped to me.<br \/><br \/>Overall though I am really enjoying this series by this author and look forward to the next one (hopefully coming soon.)<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>",

        "description":"Did the Mad Butcher of Cleveland also strike in Pennsylvania? From 1934 to 1938, Cleveland, Ohio, was racked by a classic battle between good and evil. On one side was the city's safety director, Eliot Ness. On the other was a nameless phantom dubbed the \"Mad Butcher of Kingsbury Run,\" who littered the inner city with the remains of decapitated and dismembered corpses. Never caught or even officially identified, the Butcher simply faded into history, leaving behind a frightening legend that both haunts and fascinates Cleveland to this day. In 2001 the Kent State University Press published James Jessen Badal's In the Wake of the Butcher: Cleveland's Torso Murders, the first serious, book-length treatment of this dark chapter in true crime history. Though Murder Has No Tongue: The Lost Victim of Cleveland's Mad Butcher--a detailed study of the arrest and mysterious death of Frank Dolezal, the only man ever charged in the killings--followed in 2010. Now Badal concludes his examination of the horrific cycle of murder-dismemberments with Hell's Wasteland: The Pennsylvania Torso Murders. During the mid-1920s, a vast, swampy area just across the Ohio border near New Castle, Pennsylvania, revealed a series of decapitated and otherwise mutilated bodies. In 1940 railroad workers found the rotting remains of three naked and decapitated bodies in a string of derelict boxcars awaiting destruction in Pennsylvania's Stowe Township. Were all of these terrible murders the work of Cleveland's Mad Butcher? Many in Ohio and Pennsylvania law enforcement thought they were, and that assumption led to a massive, well-coordinated two-state investigation. In Hell's Wasteland, Badal explores that nagging question in depth for the first time. Relying on police reports, unpublished memoirs, and the surviving autopsy protocols--as well as contemporary newspaper coverage-- Badal provides a detailed examination of the murder-dismemberments and weighs the evidence that potentially links them to the Cleveland carnage. Hell's Wasteland is the last piece in the gigantic torso murder puzzle that spanned three decades, covered two states, and involved law enforcement from as many as five different cities.",

        "description":"A raw and rampaging debut novel from the author of the \u201cinventive, unsparing, irreverent and consistently entertaining\u201d (NYTBR) memoir Eat the Apple-examining the war after the war for US veterans: returning home. What was it like? It's the only thing anyone wants to know about war-and the last thing Corporal Dean Pusey wants to talk about, at least not with one of these fat and happy civilians crowding the bar. Dean is two months free from the Marine Corps, and life back in his Indiana hometown is anything but peaceful. That's when the woman next to him offers to buy him a drink. Max is nice-gorgeous, funny, easy to talk to. Dean doesn't dare tell her about the sheep he took care of on his first deployment, only to watch it get torn to shreds by a pack of wild dogs; or the naked, shivering Iraqi teenager his platoon detained after an IED blast. He needs to leave all that behind and become a new person-the kind who sticks around when Max gets pregnant. He's white-knuckling it, trying to keep calm, and it's not easy. Harder still when his friend and comrade Ruiz starts showing up all over the place like he's been invited-like he didn't die a year ago. He has Max now, he has his baby daughter, River. He doesn't have time for ghosts. With his signature black humor, hard-eyed honesty, and stylistic ingenuity, Matt Young delivers a novel that turns the typical war story on its head-beginning not with enlistment but with retirement, and locating the life-or-death stakes not in battle, but in the domestic theaters of fatherhood, family, forgiveness, and love.",

        "publicationYear":2010,
        "description":"How is it that, half a century after Brown v. Board of Education, educational opportunities remain so unequal for black and white students, not to mention poor and wealthy ones?In his important new book, Five Miles Away, A World Apart, James E. Ryan answers this question by tracing the fortunes of two schools in Richmond, Virginia--one in the city and the other in the suburbs. Ryan shows how court rulings in the 1970s, limiting the scope of desegregation, laid the groundwork for the sharp disparities between urban and suburban public schools that persist to this day. The Supreme Court, in accord with the wishes of the Nixon administration, allowed the suburbs to lock nonresidents out of their school systems. City schools, whose student bodies were becoming increasingly poor and black, simply received more funding, a measure that has proven largely ineffective, while the independence (and superiority) of suburban schools remained sacrosanct. Weaving together court opinions, social science research, and compelling interviews with students, teachers, and principals, Ryan explains why all the major education reforms since the 1970s--including school finance litigation, school choice, and the No Child Left Behind Act--have failed to bridge the gap between urban and suburban schools and have unintentionally entrenched segregation by race and class. As long as that segregation continues, Ryan forcefully argues, so too will educational inequality. Ryan closes by suggesting innovative ways to promote school integration, which would take advantage of unprecedented demographic shifts and an embrace of diversity among young adults.Exhaustively researched and elegantly written by one of the nation's leading education law scholars, Five Miles Away, A World Apart ties together, like no other book, a half-century's worth of education law and politics into a coherent, if disturbing, whole. It will be of interest to anyone who has ever wondered why our schools are so unequal and whether there is anything to be done about it.",

In The Midwife of Venice, set in 1575, Hannah Levi was forced to flee Venice with the baby of a Venetian aristocratic family whom she rescued. Roberta Rich followed that action-packed adventure with The Harem Midwife, which exiled Hannah and her beloved husband Isaac to Constantinople--only for Hannah to become enmeshed in the shady politics of a sultan's harem. And now, with A Trial in Venice, set five years later, Hannah is forced back to Venice--both to opulent yet crumbling villas and the Jewish ghetto known as Veneto. Her beloved adopted son Matteo has been kidnapped and is in danger once more. And this time, so is Hannah. A rollicking and evocative read, peopled with beguiling, unforgettable characters (including the epic return of the troublesome and winsome Foscari and Cesca), this novel is a breathtaking follow up to The Midwife of Venice and The Harem Midwife, certain to shock and delight fans of the series and solidify Rich's reputation as one of Canada's most loved historical fiction authors.",

        "description":"In 1828 James, a slave, arrives in Texas, brought by his owners, Samuel and Sarah Bingham.  Texas is then a part of the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas.  James comes to Texas because he has no choice.  But once there, he finds a postrevolutionary country where slavery is on the way out and his freedom is a real possibility.  His owner, Samuel Bingham, is determined to take advantage of the low cost of land in Texas to build up a farm into a cotton plantation with the use of slave labor. Over the next nine years James will experience and participate in a series of wrenching events that marked the origins of the Lone Star State.\r\nSet in the years surrounding the 1836 Texas War of Independence, Escape from Texas is a solidly researched examination of the clashing aspirations of slaves, slave owners, Indians, and Mexicans during a turning point of the westward expansion of the United States.  \r\nWhile there are a number of novels set in this period of Texas history, Escape from Texas is the only novel that has a slave as a key protagonist and incorporates prominently that point of view of the turbulent events.  Its provocative underlying thesis is that the extension of slavery was the true underlying cause of the Texas War of Independence, not yearnings for freedom by the Texas frontiersmen, as American folklore has traditionally had it.  Escape from Texas is to the understanding of the Texas War of Independence as Howard Fast\u2019s Freedom Road was to the understanding of the post-Civil War period of Reconstruction.  \r\n\u201cA tantalizing, compelling, and learned look into an under-examined period of history that bridges the experiences of African-Americans, Mexicans, Afro-Mexicans, Native-Americans, and Anglo-Americans alike. Few other books have so keenly explored what border life may have been like in the years leading up to the Mexican-American War. Certainly, no novel has so astutely captured the mindset of black slaves and their complicated relationships with Mexico during this era. This is an unusual piece of fiction, both for its tight historical accuracy and the scope of its imagination. This is a gripping and wonderful narrative, packed with surprises, as well as new lessons in history.\u201d \u2013Ben Vinson III, Johns Hopkins University, author of *Black Mexico* and *Flight: The Story of Virgil Richardson, A Tuskegee Airman in Mexico.*",

        "description":"For Donia Bijan's family, food has been the language used for telling stories and communicating love. In 1978, when the Islamic Revolution in Iran threatened their safety, they fled to California, where the familiar flavors of Bijan's mother's cooking formed a bridge to the life they left behind. Now, through the prism of food, award-winning chef Donia Bijan unwinds her own story and finds that, at the heart of it all, is her mother. From the Persian world of her youth to the American life she embraced, from her years at Paris's Le Cordon Bleu and apprenticeships in France's three-star kitchens back to San Francisco where she opened her own celebrated bistro, Bijan evokes a vibrant kaleidoscope of cultures and cuisines. And she shares thirty inspired recipes from her childhood, her French training, and her cooking career. An exhilarating, heartfelt memoir, Maman's Homesick Pie is also a reminder of the women who encourage us to shine. Donia's love for her mother and her home, as well as for adventure and the power of good food, sings from every page.",

But House Kheperu is much more than simply a vampire house. 2011 marks the fifteenth anniversary of the core group that would become known to the world as House Kheperu. In recognition of this milestone, founder Michelle Belanger has compiled this extensive tome featuring House Kheperu's most popular and informative outer teachings. The articles and essays collected here represent material archived from the kheperu.org site as well as public elists and forums. These articles shed light on the nuances and development of the popular and widely read \"Psychic Vampire Codex\" -- the manual of magick and energy work that established House Kheperu's reputation for innovative energy work and a dynamic spiritual path. Often imitated, never duplicated, House Kheperu continues to trailblaze the territory where magick, spirituality, and energy work intersect.",

Piercing the often unconscious and destructive patterns that arise from a legacy of abuse gives rise to a clear leadership methodology, one that heals individuals across racial, political, social, and cultural divides. These stories of reckoning with trauma, pain, and socialized identity reveal how inner change can affect societal reconciliation; how it in fact directly transforms community, workplace culture, and society as a whole.",

Fuelled by a rumour-driven press and cases of notorious killers like Marry Ann Cotton, the 'Angel of Death', or Christiana Edmunds, the 'Chocolate Cream Killer', death by poisoning was a great anxiety of Victorian Britain. But what about those women who were wrongly convicted? What about the suspects who fell victim of a biased jury and unrelenting press? In _Misjudged Murderesses_, Stephen Jakobi takes a forensic approach to examine the trials of six women falsely sentenced for crimes they didn't commit. With the aid of primary sources, and in two cases the ready assistance of descendants and local journalists, the validity of their convictions is questioned. Highlighting common factors in poisoning cases that led to ostensible miscarriages of justice, Jakobi shines a light on a flawed and inconsistent legal system.",

                "comment":"<p>As the title suggests, this book contains answers to common questions non-Native people have about Native Americans\u2013everything from \u201cWhat are coming of age ceremonies?\u201d and \u201cShould Leonard Peltier be freed?\u201d to questions that seem downright rude, like \u201cWhy do Indians have so many kids?\u201d  The questions are answered by the author in a personal tone.  He is careful to say that he is answering from his own perspective and that if you ask a different person the same questions, you are likely to get some different answers.  The book is divided into chapters on terminology, history, religion and culture, education, politics, etc., so you can skip straight to the topics that interest you, or you can read straight through (like I did).<br \/><br \/>I enjoyed reading this book.  I learned plenty that I didn\u2019t know (and that I would have been afraid to ask), and I appreciated Treuer\u2019s matter of fact approach to all of the questions he addresses.  In fact, I would say this is a gracious book.  In his conclusion, he writes, \u201cDon\u2019t imagine Indians, understand them.  Keep asking questions, reading, listening and advocating for change.  Don\u2019t tolerate stereotypes, and don\u2019t be afraid to ask everything you wanted to know about Indians.  And if you\u2019re native, give a meaningful response to those questions rather than an angry rebuke.  It really does make a difference.\u201d  This book models that spirit of welcoming honest questions and giving meaningful answers.<\/p>",

It\u2019s written in Q&amp;A format loosely broken into sections (like \u201chistory\u201d, \u201ctribal languages\u201d, etc), which gives it almost a magazine-like feel\u2013it\u2019s an approachable format. Some of the \u201cquestions\u201d are like, very blunt rude things (like \u201cWhy do Indians have so many kids?\u201d) that as the title suggests people might be afraid to ask (for good reason bc it\u2019s rude AF) but address certain pervasive stereotypes, and Treuer\u2019s answers are generous, thoughtful, helpful, and funny.

                "comment":"<p>Pretty good as a basic overview. I can\u2019t speak to how clear the social-political-emotional information might be for beginners, as I feel confident and secure in my education on that front before entering. I\u2019ll say that the economic-political policy was an interesting primer, though of course I would love something more thorough.<br \/><br \/>I did feel some hesitancy on some of the ideas and points shared by Treuer. I absolutely disagree that there is little worth in Native fiction\/film and that documentaries and nonfiction are king. I disagree on the blanket assertion that the important thing for non-natives to do when interested in cultural tourism is to simply ask an elder before seeking a \u201cNative\u201d name, rather than interrogating the urge to participate in that. I disagree on how Indigenous nations and bands from Central\/South America are discussed and glossed over in this discussion and wish that we\u2019d focused solely on North American Native issues rather than just vaguely allude to Central\/South Americans as points of debate.\u00a0<br \/><br \/>I won\u2019t be the first to say that this is barely scratching the surface in so many ways. I wish there was a more\u2026 multi-sided look in the conversation about mascots- I work for a college that has a \u201cNative\u201d mascot because there is a legal-financial agreement with the relevant Nation, and I\u2019d love to hear a centrist perspective on that (regardless of my opinions and the opinions of the leftist Indigenous folks I follow). I wish there was more of a conversation about Nations that have engaged in controversial economic deals with the BIA and Congress around nuclear and fossil fuels, especially when thinking about land stewardship. I wish there were leftist and conservative Indigenous takes on these questions, though I appreciate Treuer\u2019s point that he does not speak for all Native Americans. I wish there was a conversation about tribes that are not federally recognized that was more thorough, especially in conjunction with blood quantum. I know this book is a little dated, but I wish there had been more of a conversation about the Landback movement and the \u201cAIM\u201d movement that didn\u2019t dance around their more pointed protests and ideas.<br \/><br \/>As I expected, this would have been better for me to read in high school, rather than now.<\/p>",

                "comment":"<p>Ciro Gomes declara neste livro sua vis\u00e3o sobre hist\u00f3ria recente do Brasil, porque e como chegamos onde estamos hoje. E ele faz isso com grande habilidade, a n\u00e3o leitura n\u00e3o \u00e9 cansativa e conceitos mais t\u00e9cnicos v\u00eam acompanhados de compara\u00e7\u00f5es para o p\u00fablico leigo em economia - como eu. Apesar disso, ao final, parece um folheto publicit\u00e1rio do PDT e do presidenci\u00e1vel Cir\u00e3o da Massa. Por diversas vezes, Gomes engrandece PDT como um partido progressista e desenvolvimentista, contudo fatos recentes colocam isso em d\u00favida isso, por exemplo:<br \/>- Analisando o alinhamento nas vota\u00e7\u00f5es na C\u00e2mara nos partidos de esquerda (e centro-esquerda), PDT encontra-se entre os que mais vota junto com o governo; PSB 43%, PDT 42%, REDE 31%, PCdoB 28%, PT 22% e PSOL 17%. Nas vota\u00e7\u00f5es no Senado:  PDT 73%, PT 67% e REDE 64%.* Obviamente, isso \u00e9 apenas um apanhado geral, vota\u00e7\u00f5es importantes, como Aux\u00edlio Emergencial constam como voto \u201cgovernista\u201d. Por\u00e9m, somando-se, o \u00faltimo acontecimento do Ciro Gomes retirar do candidatura** pela incapacidade de organizar seu pr\u00f3prio partido, coloca-se em d\u00favida o em que lugar ideologicamente o partido se encontra.<br \/>- PDT participou como coliga\u00e7\u00e3o nas duas elei\u00e7\u00f5es da Dilma, apesar das cr\u00edticas econ\u00f4micas espalhadas durante todo o livro.<br \/>- O Ciro Gomes do livro, \u00e9 totalmente diferente do pr\u00e9-candidato de hoje. Hoje ele aposta na corrente \u201cNem-nem\u201d (Nem Bolsonaro, Nem Lula). No livro, ele se apresenta como forte oposi\u00e7\u00e3o ao Bolsonaro e com cr\u00edticas pontuais ao Lula. E argumenta que PT nunca teve um projeto nacional para o pa\u00eds (ent\u00e3o, porque seu partido apoiou duas candidaturas da Dilma?). Nos v\u00eddeos que tenta alavancar sua baixa inten\u00e7\u00e3o de votos (entre 6-8%), aposta no antipetismo para conseguir alguns votos de bolsonaristas arrependidos, esquerdistas desanimados e uns perdidos. Claramente, pessoas de direita votariam nele apenas em um segundo turno improv\u00e1vel com Ciro presente.<br \/>- Outra coisa que coloca em cheque sua tremenda oposi\u00e7\u00e3o ao Bolsonaro hoje - como tamb\u00e9m diversos outros candidatos da chamada \u201cterceira via\u201d - \u00e9 fato de ter viajado para Paris no segundo turno das elei\u00e7\u00f5es de 2018. Quando poderia ser manifestar contra Bolsonaro, e demonstrar que apesar de o PT n\u00e3o ser o melhor para o pa\u00eds, ainda seria melhor que um candidato sem qualquer projeto de governo que utilizava o mesmo t\u00edtulo de campanha que Collor usara: contra a corrup\u00e7\u00e3o.<br \/>- Ao final, quando tenta se aproximar a todo custo do candidato crist\u00e3o. Claramente, n\u00e3o \u00e9 de uma maneira flu\u00edda, mas abrupta. E do nada engrandecer uma chamada \u201cagenda de valores\u201d - sem sequer explicar quais valores s\u00e3o estes - e coloca que esquerda se posiciona contra os crist\u00e3o (uma tremenda de uma baboseira, visto que a religi\u00e3o \u00e9 uma pauta apenas para reacion\u00e1rios, preocupados com a \u201ccristofobia\u201d). Qualquer pessoa bem informada sabe que as religi\u00f5es que passam por persegui\u00e7\u00e3o religiosa e enfrentam grande preconceito da sociedade s\u00e3o as de matriz africana - por causa disso, partidos progressistas defendem estas religi\u00f5es, ao contr\u00e1rio de apoiar a grande religi\u00e3o do status quo (leia-se, cristianismos, isso mesmo, no plural). Trata-se de mais uma tentativa de pegar os votos evang\u00e9licos do Bolsonaro.<br \/>Enfim, Ciro possui um hist\u00f3ria incr\u00edvel como pol\u00edtico. Admir\u00e1vel. Contudo, sua ambi\u00e7\u00e3o para se tornar presidente est\u00e1 ofuscando uma vit\u00f3ria. Provavelmente, enquanto o Lula for candidato, Ciro n\u00e3o possui a menor chance. A \u00fanica forma de Ciro possuir chance de ganhar \u00e9\u2026 Desconhe\u00e7o.

Do I want that on my conscience?\u201d <\/i><br \/> <br \/>This book was just a ton of fun. Mysterious artifacts, government conspiracies, fringe science, international political intrigue, an stone-cold \u201cmastermind\u201d\u2026this book was like a science-fiction version of Indiana Jones, if Indy had ever stuck around <i>after<\/i> getting back from his treasure hunting. It was solidly science fiction while still being grounded in enough real life to make it feel relatable. That\u2019s not to say the science was sound (interspecies breeding when it comes to humans is an old trope but still firmly in the realm of fiction) but it was at least recognizable, to some extent.  <br \/> <br \/>The story is told through journal entries and interviews, with a handful of radio transcripts and news reports thrown in as well. It\u2019s been done (and perhaps overdone) but it worked really well here. The interviewer becomes a character in and of himself and you come to realize that he knows a bit more than he originally lets on. I got a total Smoking Man vibe from him and loved every bit of it. Interestingly, you eventually realize that the \u201cfiles\u201d you\u2019re reading are numbered and that they are incomplete - numbers are skipped with no explanation - and I immediately wondered if this was a part of the mystery. Are they implying that there\u2019s information we\u2019re <em>not<\/em> being given? Will we see it later? As mysteries are solved more arise, teasing the reader all the way to the end.  <br \/> <br \/>All in all this book was a complete win for me. It was exciting, action-packed, plot-driven, and had just enough of a cliff-hanger to make me wish I didn\u2019t have to wait a year for the sequel.<\/p>",

I\u2019m ambivalent on the \u201cinterview\u201d style of storytelling. Not a fan of most of the characters.<br \/><br \/>The narrator is a faceless unknown G-Man figure with his hands in multiple pots and always has the upper hand in some way or fashion. The book constantly reminds me of how hot Kara is. And speaking of, Kara is immature and reads like a bratty teenager, which is not who I would have pegged as a pilot in the military. She acts and talks like a high schooler that doesn\u2019t want to work with a kid in her class. Vincent is an arrogant prick that kinda grew on me. Ryan\u2026exists. &lt;spoiler&gt;I\u2019m intrigued by Rose in the epilogue because as far as we all knew she was dead&lt;\/spoiler&gt;.\u00a0<br \/><br \/>There was a lot of time spent by the G-Men on the relationships between Kara and the two men in the short-lived, but still godawful (and consequential) love-V. I don\u2019t think for a second that an all-powerful G-Man would care about someone sleeping with their coworker(s). &lt;spoiler&gt;I\u2019m grateful the author didn\u2019t write out a sex scene. I would\u2019ve DNF\u2019d on the spot&lt;\/spoiler&gt;<br \/><br \/>  There were moments that went nowhere. I was promised a trip to Bosnia that happened completely off-page &lt;spoiler&gt;that only lent credence to a boring reveal later in the book about obvious-antagonist turned obvious-villain Alyssa&lt;\/spoiler&gt;. And there were a few action sequences that were done in a \u201coverhearing it through the phone\u201d interview style that were\u2026fine.  <br \/>Very conspiratorial \u201cgovernment stooges doing cover-ups and having the upper hand at all times\u201d thriller type stuff. Not really the book for me, to be honest. I might try the sequel and see where it goes.<\/p>",

        "description":"A recently discovered account of an Austrian Jewish writer's flight, persecution, and clandestine life in wartime France. As arts editor for one of Vienna's principal newspapers, Moriz Scheyer knew many of the city's foremost artists, and was an important literary journalist. With the advent of the Nazis he was forced from both job and home. In 1943, in hiding in France, Scheyer began drafting what was to become this book. Tracing events from the Anschluss in Vienna, through life in Paris and unoccupied France, including a period in a French concentration camp, contact with the Resistance, and clandestine life in a convent caring for mentally disabled women, he gives an extraordinarily vivid account of the events and experience of persecution. After Scheyer's death in 1949, his stepson, disliking the book's anti-German rhetoric, destroyed the manuscript. Or thought he did. Recently, a carbon copy was found in the family's attic by P.N. Singer, Scheyer's step-grandson, who has translated and provided an epilogue.",

The Titanic has often been called \"An exquisite microcosm of the Edwardian era,\u201d but until now, her story has not been presented as such. In Gilded Lives, Fatal Voyage, historian Hugh Brewster seamlessly interweaves personal narratives of the lost liner\u2019s most fascinating people with a haunting account of the fateful maiden crossing. Employing scrupulous research and featuring 100 rarely seen photographs, he accurately depicts the ship\u2019s brief life and tragic denouement and presents compelling, memorable portraits of her most notable passengers: millionaires John Jacob Astor and Benjamin Guggenheim; President Taft's closest aide, Major Archibald Butt; writer Helen Churchill Candee; the artist Frank Millet; movie actress Dorothy Gibson; the celebrated couturiere Lady Duff Gordon; aristocrat Noelle, the Countess of Rothes; and a host of other travelers. Through them, we gain insight into the arts, politics, culture, and sexual mores of a world both distant and near to our own. And with them, we gather on the Titanic\u2019s sloping deck on that cold, starlit night and observe their all-too-human reactions as the disaster unfolds.

The land all around is empty except for cactus and sagebrush, mostly shades of rust and gray, and the only green for many miles are the squares of lawns in Tumbleweed Terrace, which, from a vulture's point of view, probably looks as alien as a place to raise your kids on Mars. \r\n\r\nTumbleweed Terrace had burst upon the defenseless desert with snarling trucks and roaring bulldozers, screaming saws and thudding air hammers, during America\u2019s last housing boom, but then a bust had broken its back and the project has languished for over a decade with most of its houses unoccupied - those that have actually been built - while others are still only skeletons of slowly shriveling two-by-four bones. The huge shopping mall has never opened, its doorways boarded with sheets of plywood, its signs of Sears, Footlocker, Best Buy, The Gap, Ross, and Starbucks, fading and never lighted at night. The wide but mostly empty streets, laid out in aesthetic meandering patterns and lined with sun-bleached sidewalks that have never known the rattle of skateboards, wander though acres of blank-windowed empty or only partly completed homes; and there are many dusty lots with only barren concrete foundations and raw earth holes for swimming pools.\r\n\r\nDustin Rhodes and his mom and dad are not only one of the very few families who live in this nice suburban ghost town - the only dwellers on Trader Rat Lane - but also the only black people. Dustin home-schools online, while his father, a Fed-Ex pilot, and his mother, a train dispatcher, are usually away; and Dustin has known mostly solitude for all his thirteen years, though he has a TV and computer, a love of reading books, a \"not-dog\" named Spot, and most of the coolest video games, including one called Magic Rats, which he frequently plays with a cyber-friend. Perhaps he thinks he's not really lonely, but after he shows kindness to an elderly Apache shaman, someone moves into the house next door. At first they appear to be only a middle-aged man-and-wife, friendly and seemingly nice, but Dustin soon discovers they seem to be hiding someone in their house. Dustin begins to investigate and comes to the conclusion that it must be a boy of around his own age\u2026 but why is he being hidden?",

But when Jill is caught between husband and paramour, her idyllic days turn into nightmare. Even in this generous land, Captain Hook is a dangerous man. The lonesome Captain Cecco rescues Raven, an Indian widow who diverts him from his obsession for Jill. But Hook, too, finds Raven tempting. As his need for her heightens, so does the rivalry of Jill's tempestuous men. Jill's own charms turn against her when a clever hunter from the Indian tribe stalks her heart. As tribal taboo is violated, the balance of the Neverland shifts like an overturned hourglass. Left on her own in an amorous trap, Jill must conjure her most potent magic. The enchanted isle can be openhanded with hospitality, and with treachery too. In order to thrive-- or survive-- Hook and Jill, like their allies and adversaries, may be forced to give as liberally as their Island. Jill's kiss may bring bliss or a curse, yet one thing is certain. Whatever else might be lost, Captain Hook never loses command. Other Islands, Book Three of the award-winning Hook & Jill Saga, is a worthy sequel to masterworks. Lush with literary elegance, this story explores forms of generosity-- usual, and unusual. As in Hook & Jill, J.M. Barrie's Neverland evolves. Andrea Jones re-imagines this timeless island, \"always changing, yet ever the same.\" Be watching for five books in this series, closely based on J.M. Barrie's classic work, Peter and Wendy.",

                "comment":"<p>Warrior\u2019s Rise by LJ DeLeon is the first book of an epic paranormal urban fantasy series.<br \/><br \/>The world created by DeLeon is cohabited by normal people (that\u2019s us \u2013 at least I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re normal?) and supes (weres, fae, mages, Druids, daemons, vampires, gargoyles, basilisks, and any other magical creature you\u2019ve ever seen in any other book).<br \/><br \/>Many of the supes are good, working to keep the planet in balance in service to The Goddess. Some, however, are evil. And some of those evil guys hold influential positions in business and governmental agencies. (That\u2019s explains a lot, eh?) All of the supes are undercover, posing as Norms. The human race is completely unaware of their presence in their midst.<br \/><br \/>Imagine the surprise and complete panic as the deception is revealed when the Dark Lord sets out to take down the veil between the Underworld and our world.<br \/><br \/>Fortunately, the humans and good supes have someone powerful on their side in their battle against the powers of evil \u2013 the Caidh Arm, Deva. She\u2019s a young bartender who is raised up and given lots of cool supernatural powers by The Goddess.<br \/><br \/>Where there\u2019s a young, beautiful heroine, there must be a tall, dark, and handsome hero. In this book, that\u2019s Paidrag, Crown Prince of the Fae. And you can guess what happens next. There\u2019s a little cha-cha-cha, but mostly it\u2019s the soul mate telepathy stuff.<br \/><br \/>Deva and Paidrag must overcome obstacles to gather their forces to prepare for the oncoming war.<br \/><br \/>There are a few battle scenes, but they are as sketchy as the sex scenes. In the middle of the war, Deva, Paidrag, and many of their leadership team are able to take a few days off to go the the court of the Fae for their wedding. This is where the first book ends.<br \/><br \/>There\u2019s a lot of imagination here, but not enough action. A lot of threats, a little fighting, a little sex, a lot of Deva\u2019s interior monologue \u2013 I want more conflict out of a fantasy about an epic war between good and evil.<br \/><br \/>Some of the Amazon reviews complain about poor editing. I agree that it could be better, but it only disrupted the flow of my reading a few times. They also complain about the juvenile writing. Epic fantasy isn\u2019t exactly known for nuance in character or layering in plot. The problem is that this epic just isn\u2019t nearly epic enough, leaving the lack of nuance and layering readily  apparent.<br \/><br \/>I\u2019m sure the author\u2019s skills will grow as she continues writing this series. I just didn\u2019t like this book enough to invest $5 for the second book in the series.<br \/><br \/>I\u2019m giving this book 3 stars as it was enjoyable for the imaginative world DeLeon has created.<\/p>",

Interesting title work.<br \/><br \/>The first half or so of this one was good. I enjoyed the writing. The pace was fairly good. I loved the comradery between the friends. I wasn\u2019t a HUGE fan of the heroine, but she certainly wasn\u2019t the worst I have ever read. Although I found it extremely unlikely that some scared little mouse would go from a victim of severe domestic abuse to an MMA fighter in a few weeks.<br \/><br \/> <br \/><br \/>But then around 60% this book took a nose dive and became over the top ridiculous. Bailey is fighting like a lunatic with the police that goes on to cause riots. Back talking to a judge. Ex-girlfriend drama. Baby mama drama. Cartel connections. An eye rolling twist that made me lose all the respect I had for the heroine. Not that I had any left considering she believed that the hero <spoiler>killed his baby<\/spoiler> How can you claim to love someone but take the word of a crazy ex??!!  Add in the fact that this late in a book I should have been feeling more of a connection between the H\/h than I did. This went way downhill quickly, and I had to force myself to continue.<br \/><br \/>The drama llama was strong in this one, and that is what ultimately led this one to only getting 2-Stars from yours truly. <br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>",

        "publicationYear":2023,
        "description":"A landmark volume about the importance of housing in social life. In 1947, the president of the American Sociological Association argued for the importance of housing as a field of sociological research. Yet seventy-five years later, the sociology of housing has not developed as a distinct field, leaving efforts to understand housing's place in society to other disciplines, such as economics and urban planning. This volume intends to change that, solidifying the place of housing studies as a distinct subfield within the discipline of sociology, showing that housing is both an important element of sociology and a significant component of social life that deserves dedicated attention as a distinct area of research. To do so, the book takes stock of the current field of scholarship and provides new directions for study. The contributors showcase the very best traditions of sociology--they draw on diverse methodological approaches, present unique field sites and data sources, and foreground sociological theory to understand contemporary housing issues. The Sociology of Housing will be a landmark volume, used by researchers and students alike as an introduction to this crucial field and a map of its future potential.",

It\u2019s a good representation on the hero in the story. Simple yet attractive typography. I probably would have lined up the \u201cA DD\/LG OUTING\u201d so it was directly under RACING and lined up with DIRTY and the author\u2019s name. Again that is just the picky graphic designer in me coming out. Overall though it\u2019s a great cover. <br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>Whoa, Nelly was this book SMOKIN\u2019 HOT. It is a short little novella about a day out at the races for a Daddy Dom and his little. Don\u2019t expect a lot of depth or character development. That said it was still a cracking good read with some incredibly yummy sex scenes. It also includes some exhibitionism and sharing.<br \/><br \/>I did have one slight issue, and it was with the sharing portion of the book. I do not mind sharing when all parties are A-OK with it (as was the case here.) My issue was the three friends of Richard\u2019s (Daddy) were married men who had left their wives at home because they like to \u201cenjoy the race bunnies\u201d It made me think these guys were creepy cheaters. I am just going to assume that they all have open marriages and leave it at that. ;D<br \/><br \/>Two thumbs up from yours truly!<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>",

        "description":"\"A fearless and darkly comic essay collection about race, justice, and the limits of good intentions. In this stunning debut collection, Catapult editor-in-chief and award-winning voice actor Tajja Isen explores the absurdity of living in a world that has grown fluent in the language of social justice but doesn't always follow through. These nine daring essays explore the sometimes troubling and often awkward nature of that discord. Some of My Best Friends takes on the cartoon industry's pivot away from colorblind casting, the pursuit of diverse representation in the literary world, the law's refusal to see inequality, and the cozy fictions of nationalism. Isen deftly examines the quick, cosmetic fixes society makes to address systemic problems, and reveals the unexpected ways they can misfire. ...Isen interlaces cultural criticism with her lived experience to explore the gaps between what we say and what we do, what we do and what we value, what we value and what we demand.\"--Publisher's website.",

This book makes a comprehensive state-of-the-art review of some of the most significant elements and results about the geometrodynamic picture determined by the quantum potential in various contexts. Above all, the book explores the perspectives about the fundamental arena subtended by the quantum potential, the link between the geometry associated to the quantum potential and a fundamental quantum vacuum. After an analysis of the geometry subtended by the quantum potential in the different fields of quantum physics (the non-relativistic domain, the relativistic domain, the relativistic quantum field theory, the quantum gravity domain and the canonical quantum cosmology), in the second part of the book, a recent interpretation of Bohm's quantum potential in terms of a more fundamental entity called quantum entropy, the approach of the symmetryzed quantum potential and the link between quantum potential and quantum vacuum are analysed, also in the light of the results obtained by the author.",

Grounded in financial statements, Pratt's Financial Accountinghelps students see the impact of transactions on overall business decisions. The text enables MBA students to become effective managers and decision-makers by encouraging them to develop a conceptual understanding of the impact that economic events have on a business. The newest edition on this popular text addresses topics that today's accountants and managers must consider: increased impacts of IFRS, fair value reporting, segment reporting and an earnings management framework. While addressing recent developments and maintaining the perspective of the previous editions, Financial Accounting in an Economic Context 8th Editionoffers new elements designed to sharpen the text's economic decisions-making foundation. The text highlights the differences between IFRS and GAAP throughout each chapter. Each chapter closes with a \"Issue for Discussion\" feature, allowing students to apply data found in the financial statements of an international company. New boxed-in features illustrate the effects of accounting transitions on cash flow of statements and new end of chapter items address the cash flow effects of accounting transactions\"--",

Now Bill, Jaime, and seventeen other horror-loving teens have gathered at Rabbit in Red Studios, the brainchild of eccentric horror producer Jay \"JB\" Bell, for the terror-filled, blood-drenched contest of their lives. JB has presented this competition as a race between the best of the best that will reward the winners with cash, internships, and a career making the movies they love. But things aren't always as they seem at Rabbit in Red, and soon life starts to imitate art. Will Bill and Jaime be strong enough to confront real horror to save their friends, or will they all fall victim to JB's twisted plans?",

Nevertheless, the theoretical foundations underlying modern liberalism continue to be contested by proponents and opponents alike. The Myth of Liberalism offers a unique contribution to this debate by following through on the often-underdeveloped suggestion that liberal principles are untenable because they are self-contradictory. By analyzing and ultimately refuting each of the proposed underpinnings of liberalism - liberty, equality, rights, privacy, autonomy, or dignity - Safranek concludes that contemporary liberalism is a myth: it is not a coherent political philosophy as much as a collection of causes masked by emotively potent political rhetoric.",

Priests play a vital role in the Christian community but often need more support and encouragement than they receive. Providing a firsthand perspective, O Priest, Who Are You? delves deep into the profound meaning of the priesthood, providing invaluable insights into the role and identity of priests. Contradicting the popular belief that a priest\u2019s sole duty is celebrating Mass, author Fr. Thanh Tran provides a comprehensive understanding of the diverse tasks and responsibilities that priests undertake. He illuminates the rich history of the priesthood, exploring its challenges, trials, and sources of inspiration and joy. Along the way, Tran shares some of his remarkable encounters as a priest, offering motivation to those grappling with the demands of their vocation and inspiration for young men to seriously consider embracing this vocation as a viable option for their own lives. This book presents a faith-filled examination of priesthood, seeking to bring clarity and depth in an examination of the concept and responsibilities of the role.",

Praise for An Indispensable Truth: How Fusion Power Can Save the Planet: \"In this study Professor Chen outlines the underlying physics, recent progress in achieving advanced plasmas and magnetic confinement, and hopes for the future. He recognizes the difficulties that remain in engineering a fusion reactor, but he remains optimistic regarding ultimate success, yet fearful of the consequences were we to fail.\"- James R. Schlesinger, former Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission; Director, Central Intelligence Agency; Secretary of Defense; and Secretary of Energy \"With lots of detail and examples, Chen brings the technical topic of fusion to life, making the book a great read for scientists and nonscientists alike.\"- Representative Rush Holt (D-NJ) \"Professor Chen has opened the door to energy survival for our globe. His insightful analysis makes the case for fusion energy, and he conveys both its complexity and its promise. This book is a must for all those who are concerned about the energy future of our species.\"- Raymond L Orbach, former Undersecretary for Science, U.S. Department of Energy \"This is an important book for anyone who wishes to understand the greatest challenge we face. Frank Chen makes the science of fusion and energy clear, compelling, and hugely enjoyable.\"- Steven Cowley, Director and CEO, Culham Centre for Fusion Energy, United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority",

Ronnie Spector\u2019s first collaboration with producer Phil Spector, \u201cBe My Baby,\u201d stunned the world and shot girl group the Ronettes to stardom. No one could sing as clearly, as emotively as Ronnie. But her voice was soon drowned out in Phil Spector\u2019s Wall of Sound, and lost in Ronnie and Phil\u2019s ensuing romance and marriage. Ronnie had to fight tooth and nail to wrest back control of her life, her music, and her legacy. And while she regained her footing, Ronnie found herself recording with Stevie Van Zandt, partying with David Bowie, and touring with Bruce Springsteen. Smart, humorous, and self-possessed, Be My Baby is a whirlwind account of the twists and turns in the life of an artist. More than anything, Be My Baby is a testament to the fact that it is possible to stand up to a powerful abuser and start on a second\u2014or third, or fifth\u2014act. Includes photographs and an introduction by Keith Richards",

The caul indicates rare powers, especially a tendency toward \"second sight.\" Mary's special gift of seeing manifests itself in visions of ghosts and spirits and culminates in an uncanny musical ability. But her remarkable gifts set her apart from her Pittsburgh neighbors, and she is shunned and belittled. Mary's loneliness is compounded by her mother's cruelty and indifference. She must find her own way through the tangled web of difficulties she faces everyday, and her music becomes her refuge. Gradually, though, Mary learns that music is more than just an escape from her problems. By losing herself in her extraordinary musical creativity, she grapples with her inner demons and discovers the true power of her special gifts.",

        "description":"America The Story of Us is a groundbreaking series that brings to life the epic story of our nation in a new way for a new generation. The companion book, America The Story of Us is a history that is at once penetrating and lively, elegant and authoritative; great for serious reading as it is for casual skimming. America The Story of Us brings to life the vast forces that shaped this remarkable country and the ways in which revolutions in technology and transportation altered the way Americans lived, made money, and fought one another. Explored in these pages is the struggle between settlers and Native Americans; the epic conflict of slavery, from cotton gin to Civil War; the creation of the transcontinental railroad alongside the thundering herds of buffalo across the West; and how American ingenuity and determination both carried us through the Great Depression and won the Second World War. Beginning with Jamestown and Plymouth Bay, the first successful British colonies on the mainland, the book highlights the landmark moments in political, social, economic, and military history, from the prototypical entrepreneur John Rolfe and his tobacco seeds to Barack Obama and the seeds of change, from the Model T to the moon landing. Written by novelist, historian, and journalist Kevin Baker (a key contributor to The American Century, by Harold Evans), the narrative shares the TV series- eye for the dramatic moment in U.S. history-there is danger, action, struggle-while adding new layers of detail and nuance. America The Story of Us is decisive and essential, the story of the country that every family will want to own. Foreword by President Obama A stunning companion piece for the most anticipated HISTORY broadcast of all time, includes 412 heavily illustrated pages featuring over 300 full color images and layers of information including \"charticles,\u201d graphics, photographs, and text. The adventure that became a nation - the complete history of the US has not been told for 40 years. AMERICA the Story of Us is an exuberant, unprecedented look at the invention of America focusing on how events small and large are intrinsically linked to the exploration and innovation, leading us from the frontier to 21st century cities, from the Mississippi to the moon, from Jamestown to 9\/11 up to present day. Moving though time and space linking key events, people and locations, capturing the vast sweep of American history-- bringing viewers on a journey through the forces that shaped the destiny of America.",

Guy Haines ends up telling him all about his wife who cheated on him and is pregnant with another man\u00b4s child.  With a little prodding from Charlie, Guy admits that he hates his wife.  Charlie tells him he hates his father and begins to tell Guy about his plan for the perfect murder.  His idea is that they kill for each other and no one would suspect either of them because they had no reason to kill people they didn\u00b4t know.  Guy is horrified and quickly leaves thinking Charlie is just drunk.  He was serious though as Guy finds out when he gets the call that his wife has been murdered.  Charlie starts to call him and Guy realizes why\u2026.  Charlie wants him to finish the plan he had dreamed up.<br \/><br \/>When I first started reading this book I was intrigued by the story but not even half way I started to lose interest.  The whole thing seemed so improbable.  The more it went on the more outlandish it seemed.

                "comment":"<p>As a suspense novel, Strangers on a Train didn\u2019t read like I expected it to. Modern thrillers tend to follow the same formula: 200-pages of mediocre plot and characters all leading up to some twist or groundbreaking moment. But this classic novel by Patricia Highsmith is a slow burn where you pretty much expect everything that is going to happen, and it\u2019s all the more unsettling when it does. <br \/><br \/>Strangers on a Train was much better written than most thrillers I have read. I think some people go into it with the wrong expectations and think, \u201cthis is boring, why isn\u2019t the author messing with ME?\u201d But this novel is more of a character study. The thought processes of Highsmith\u2019s characters are extremely believable, even when they are annoying or pathetic, and murder is treated simultaneously as a casual and grave occurrence. I found her writing extremely impressive and hope to emulate her in my own writing.<br \/><br \/>Also, there were definitely some Freudian overtones appropriate for the time (1950). It makes sense why Alfred Hitchcock chose to make a movie of it.<\/p>",

One had merely to look for a little of either to find it all, one had merely to scratch the surface. All things had opposites close by, every decision a reason against it, every animal an animal that destroys it, the male the female, the positive the negative. The splitting of the atom was the only true destruction, the breaking of the universal law of oneness. Nothing could be without its opposite that was bound up with it. Could space exist in a building without objects that stopped it? Could energy exist without matter, or matter without energy? Matter and energy, the inert and the active, once considered opposites, were now known to be one.\u201d<\/p>",

                "comment":"<p>The two men in \u201cStrangers On A Train\u201d are despicable people. One, a well-off psychopath who berates women, and the other is a brilliant yet insecure fella who lacks a few basic moral filters. Perhaps n\u00famero dos is not too bad in the beginning, but time will tell as the novel chugs along. Does the dynamic fit a twisty murder plot? To me, the book has flashes of brilliance, but some of the melodrama and filler irked me quite a bit.  <br \/><br \/>Guy and Bruno meet on a train. A few drinks are shared, and before long, Bruno lays out a perfect murder. Bruno will murder Guy\u2019s wife; he is on his way to divorce, and Guy will in turn murder Bruno\u2019s father. Does this sound like a foolproof idea to you?  <br \/> <br \/>If you can get past the \u2018perfect\u2019 meetup and subsequent murder coercing, I think you might enjoy it a bit more than I did. The chapter describing the deed was an eerie look into the mind of a psychopath and included quite a bit of introspection. This, coupled with the extreme detail, really set the tone for the rest of the book. Sadly, it takes until about the last third to really ramp up again. The middle portion of the book is filled with too much melodrama and philosophical takes, which I usually enjoy, but it sort of plateaued for me. It is understandable that these characters would get caught up in these ramblings of crime, but it hits it over the head a bit too much. It all could have been compacted a bit more. The alcoholism, the blackouts, and the staunch remarks started to get pretty grating. Also, it never really hits that sense of Annie Wilkes type crazy, if you know what I mean. Maybe we are just a bit desensitized to these types of stories, but back when this was published, I\u2019m sure it was eye-opening.   <br \/><br \/>On the other hand, the writing is pretty great. I read that the movie iteration was directed by Hitchcock, and this makes perfect sense. The stalking chapter in particular had a Hitchcockian feel to it, so I can see why he would gravitate toward it. Oh! One more point. The murder in and of itself was pretty clever. Back then, it would have been almost impossible for authorities to catch on to how it was committed. There is some detective work that shows up in the last third or so, but the \u2018gotcha\u2019 moments are pretty far-fetched and frankly uninteresting in my opinion. I can definitely see other writers being influenced by the interrogation scenes as well. Karen Slaughter comes to mind.   <br \/><br \/>All in all, it had some amazing moments, but I feel like it could be trimmed up a bit. My advice would be to go into it not expecting a cat-and-mouse chase or an in-depth character story, just some tension surrounding a few blokes who devise a creative act of evil. A more sinister version of My Dinner with Andre, for example.<\/p>",

She needed a professional cover designer. She needed a professional editor. She needed a professional proofreader. And she needed a professional to layout the ebook. This is so unprofessionally packaged, and I will never respect a book that is so unprofessionally packaged. The author needs to care more about her book than I do. <br \/><br \/>Having said that, this is a good idea for a book and a not-too-bad first draft. I\u2019d read it again and give it a different review if the author cares enough to do it right and reissue it.<\/p>",

                "comment":"<p>This was a great story and I love the \u201cbook about a book\u201d premise. The book gives us three somewhat unreliable narrators; not unreliable in the sense that they\u2019re untrustworthy but rather that they have their own secrets, biases, and goals that don\u2019t always align with what\u2019s going on during the investigation. With constantly changing perspectives, I was always reevaluating the characters - whether they could be trusted, whether they were involved in the murder, and just what their intentions were. The plot was complex and layered, with new information being uncovered constantly. Claire\u2019s diary entries and snippets of R.M. Holland\u2019s story, The Stranger, are sprinkled throughout the book, adding additional layers of interest. I absolutely loved that we got The Stranger in full at the end of the book and enjoyed it in its own right. I\u2019ll definitely be picking up more by Griffiths in the future.<br \/><br \/>(Thank you to NetGalley and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt for an advance copy of the book for review.)<\/p>",

I wish they drew more parallels between the murders and the book. I know it\u2019s unoriginal to have a copy-cat killer but if you\u2019re focusing this much on classic literature in a murder case you might as well go all out. <br \/>I listened to this as an audiobook which subtracted from the reading experience. Three out of four of the povs\u2019 are British female characters and there\u2019s ten female characters with a speaking role so it\u2019s easy to get lost. <br \/>None of these characters have normal reactions and they\u2019re so nonchalant about murder. If you were working at a school that your daughter attended and one of your coworkers was murdered I feel as though that would make someone distressed and worried, not bitter that she has to watch rehearsals for a play. <br \/>There\u2019s a weird bit where she\u2019s withholding information from the police because she doesn\u2019t want the deceased to get \u2018victim blamed\u2019 because she was involved in an affair. Her friend is dead and she\u2019s more worried about her supposed \u201cfeminism.\u201d<br \/>I really dislike the daughter\u2019s pov. It feels unnecessary and barely progresses the plot. I didn\u2019t enjoy it because of the secondhand embarrassment I get from adults trying to write teenagers.<br \/>Now what the fck was the mother thinking letting her 15-year-old date a 21-year-old? The Dad doesn\u2019t like the boyfriend but it\u2019s not even because of the gross age gap! I understand why he had to be older for the awful twist but I still hate all of it.<br \/>Hate the villain, I don\u2019t feel like it makes sense and didn\u2019t see it hinted anywhere in the plot. All the stuff with the author didn\u2019t really matter and was pretty much a red herring. And then to top it all off at the end of the book they\u2019re talking about forgiveness. It\u2019s not just some school boy crush. He killed two people. He is a murderer and a stalker and he dated a 15-year-old to get closer to her mother.<\/p>",

        "description":"Jewish Domination of Weimar Germany was the National Socialist government's first English-language attempt to explain the rationale behind their legislative moves to restrict Jewish influence in Germany after 1933. Using official pre-Nazi-era demographics, this work showed that Jews were massively over-represented in all fields of German social and economic life-except that of farming and creative work. It lists the ownership of mass media in Weimar Germany, the astonishing financial scandals, Communism and political subversion, degenerate theater, sexual psychology, Communist indoctrination in educational institutions and the media-all of which was predominantly Jewish in origin. This new edition contains the entire original text and illustrations, and benefits from a series of appendixes which reveal: - The measures taken by the Nazi state against Jews; - Details of the Havaara transfer Agreement whereby the Nazi government and the World Zionist movement worked together to help create the state of Israel; - The World Jewish declaration of war against Germany in 1933; and - A series of eye-opening parallels between Weimar Germany and the present-day United States of America, showing exactly the same trends of Jewish domination of educational institutions, the mass media, and financial scandals-proof that history does repeat itself.",

                "comment":"<p>Ik leerde eigenlijk heel toevallig van het bestaan af van dit boek, doordat het me werd aangeraden op Storytel. De titel sprak me direct aan en met een korte zoekopdracht in Goodreads leerde ik dat dit een deel twee was in een nieuwe politieserie van Elly Griffiths. Meer nog, ik leerde dat ik deel \u00e9\u00e9n van deze serie al in 2019 had gelezen, zonder dat toen sprake was dat dit het begin van een nieuwe serie zou zijn!<br \/><br \/>Hoewel ik in mijn recensie op Goodreads niet super positief was over dit eerste deel, herinnerde ik mij nu wel vooral de dreigende atmosfeer dat goed de spanning wist op te bouwen. Mijn negativiteit ging vooral naar de ontknoping, en ervaring leert mij dat dit vaak heel erg een momentopname is. Soms kan een ontknoping mij totaal tegen vallen, terwijl een gelijkaardige ontknoping op een later moment wel heel goed in de smaak valt.<br \/>Dus met deze kennis en mijn intrige door de titel van dit tweede deel, startte ik dit audioboek.<br \/><br \/>Dit was echt een boek in het genre <i>cozy murder mystery<\/i> en ik heb voor het merendeel echt wel genoten van dit luisterboek, terwijl ik gezellig hakend of breiend op de bank zat. Het begin was super intrigerend, maar onderweg nam de interesse bij mij wel een beetje af. Uiteindelijk was dit wel een leuk boek voor wat licht entertainment en escapisme, maar niet super memorabel, en soms is dat gewoon prima.<\/p>",

Six weeks out of his most recent rehab, Clegg returns to New York and starts attending two or three meetings each day. It is in these refuges that he befriends essential new allies including Polly, who struggles daily with her own cycle of recovery and relapse, and the seemingly unshakably sober Asa. At first, the support is not enough: Clegg relapses with only three days left. That's when the battle to reclaim his life gets reignited. As any recovering addict knows, hitting rock bottom is just the beginning.",

        "title":"Maxime Weygand and Civil-military Relations in Modern France",
        "publicationYear":null,
        "description":"Between the two World Wars, particularly in the 1930s, the relations between the French civilian government and the Army went through a series of devastating changes. These turbulent developments culminated in the refusal of the Army's leaders to obey their civilian superiors during the catastrophe of June 1940, the first such insubordination in modern French republican history. The author examines every aspect of this disastrous process, pursuing his analysis largely through the activities and thought of General Maxime Weygand, who, although deeply affected by the loss of civil-military trust, contributed importantly to it and eventually led the Army in its disobedience. \r\n\r\nMr. Bankwitz finds the seeds of the disaffection between the French civilian authorities and the military in a variety of interconnected elements. During the early 1930s, for example, the soldiers became convinced that the Government's policies concerning service time, military appropriations, and disarmament were pushing the Army to the brink of ruin. The Third Republic was highly unstable politically, as was shockingly demonstrated in February 1934 when the Government leaders resigned in the face of violent disorders in Paris attendant on the Stavisky Affair which climaxed two years of internal strife. Among soldiers, aware of the Government's weakness, suspicious of its alleged antimilitarism, and fearful of the approaching conflict with Nazi Germany, there was a growing and almost unconscious tendency to think in terms of the possible need to extend the protection of the Army to the nation in its difficulties. In this way, important elements in the officer corps began, psychologically and emotionally, \"to prepare for eventual intervention in national political affairs.\" \r\n\r\nGeneral Weygand, whom the author interviewed on numerous occasions, held the personal conviction that the distrust between the civilian and military establishments was the root cause of French defeat. Mr. Bankwitz is convinced that this opinion of Weygand's is possibly the single most important clue to the puzzling connection between the civil-military relationship and the collapse of June 1940. Granting all the other factors contributing to the defeat, it would be impossible to exaggerate the historical importance of Weygand's disobedience--an act which also opened the way for later military saviors and for the ascendant role of the Army in French politics. \r\n\r\nThis is the first scholarly study in depth of the crucial prewar phase of the French army's development into a disruptive force in national life. A chapter from the portentous twentieth-century story of the soldier in politics, it has relevance now to situations already formed or forming in other western societies. The value of the book is greatly enhanced by an encyclopedic bibliography of writing on French political history in this century.",

'Told with a deepening sense of the unease, seasoned with a touch of the occult' Daily Mail Ruth has excavated a body from the grounds of Norwich Castle, which was once a prison. The body may be that of Victorian murderess Jemima Green. Called Mother Hook for her claw-like hand, Jemima was hanged for the murder of five children. DCI Harry Nelson has no time for long-ago killers. Investigating the case of three infants found dead, one after the other, in their King's Lynn home, he's convinced that their mother is responsible. Then a child goes missing. Could the abduction be linked to the long-dead Mother Hook? Ruth is pulled into the case, and back towards Nelson.",

When Ruth\u2019s friend Cathbad sees a vision of the Virgin Mary\u2014in a white gown and blue cloak\u2014in the graveyard next to the cottage he is house-sitting, he takes it in his stride. Walsingham has strong connections to Mary, and Cathbad is a druid after all; visions come with the job. But when the body of a woman in a blue dressing-gown is found dead the next day in a nearby ditch, it is clear Cathbad\u2019s vision was all too human\u2014and that a horrible crime has been committed. DCI Nelson and his team are called in for the murder investigation and soon establish that the dead woman was a recovering addict being treated at a nearby private hospital. Ruth, a devout atheist, has managed to avoid Walsingham during her seventeen years in Norfolk. But then an old university friend, Hilary Smithson, asks to meet her in the village, and Ruth is amazed to discover that her friend is now a priest. Hilary has been receiving vitriolic anonymous letters targeting women priests\u2014 letters containing references to local archaeology and a striking phrase about a woman \"clad in blue, weeping for the world.\" Then another woman is murdered\u2014a priest. As Walsingham prepares for its annual Easter re-enactment of the Crucifixion, the race is on to unmask the killer before they strike again...",

I can\u2019t summarize it here, but I was incredibly moved by it as a story of isolation, loneliness, memory, loss, the relationship between thought and time and art, and how all of our experience combines within our minds to formulate life, experience\u2013 ourselves. It is, at its core, a novel of intricately executed interiority, presented as a spiraling fun house filled with trapdoors of self-awareness and the inescapable primacy of subjectivity. It is also laugh out loud funny; it brought me so many laughs and so much joy as a caustic takedown of contemporary culture and thinking. It was a book I looked forward to picking up each night, and now that it is over, I already miss it. As with any art, your mileage may vary, but this is a book to which I feel a deep connection and which brought me so much melancomic happiness. Calcium forever. \u2764\ufe0f<\/p>",

What is the history of science denial, what's different now, and why does it seem worse? In this opening chapter, What is the Problem and Why Does it Matter? Sinatra and Hofer chart the development of this problem, examine how doubt has also been manufactured, and explain how media attempts at \"balance\" can become a form of bias. While acknowledging the limits and fallibility of science, they argue that if the US is to be a leader in sustainable economic and social progress, a greater percentage of Americans need to value, understand, and accept scientific methods and findings. When so many US citizens deny science, the health and wellbeing of Americans and our hopes for a sustainable future are put in peril.\"--",

        "description":"Rob Coen has a mission he has reluctantly chosen - to interview the newly re-elected Wyoming governor, James Alexander, a populist politician who has seemingly reinvented not only his state's politics, but also its soul. No one could more strongly contrast with Coen, a big-city, liberal journalist, than the rural, Bible-thumping Alexander and his strange social and religious projects, which include constructing Mount Calvary, a monument to the Crucifixion atop a man-made mountain. Coen quickly becomes personally invested, and his trip to interview Alexander becomes a joust, pitting his nihilism against the faith of the people whom he meets as he seeks to discern the lie he is convinced hides at the heart of their righteous kingdom. At the same time, Coen begins to realize that he himself is being swept up in a struggle beyond his understanding orchestrated by forces out of his control. With prose as vivid and scenic as the majestic Wyoming landscapes it describes, Let Them Look West draws the reader into a story of discovery and intrigue which serves as a backdrop to a fundamental clash of worldviews - one secular and materialist, the other spiritual and transcendent. The tale twists and turns until its climax, which calls into question the true meaning of what has transpired. Antelope Hill is proud to present our first fictional contribution, Let Them Look West by author Marty Phillips.",

Nice title work. <br \/><br \/>I enjoyed this one a lot. It would have been a 5-Star read for me if not for one little issue that I will address later. Like I said in my review for the previous book this author has a very engaging writing style and this book was no different. I was sucked in from page one. It was also well paced and the plot interesting. There was no OW\/OM drama. Very little angst. Smokin\u2019 sex scenes. An amazing cast of secondary characters. In fact, I think the secondary characters are what made this book so fantastic. I ADORED the comradery between the guys, and I LOVED Sage\u2019s grandma. As for the main characters, well let us start with Lukas who in my opinion was pretty much the perfect hero. He was sexy as f@ck. He was alpha. He was damaged. He was vulnerable. He was a little goofy. He never gave up on Sage when honestly I felt he should have dropped kick her ass right out of his life. <br \/><br \/> <br \/><br \/>Which brings me to why this lost a star for me, Sage. I could not stand her. I am not a big fan of heroine\u2019s that can\u2019t \u201cdo\u201d love or commitment because OMG their parents had a bad relationship. Seriously? What are you five? And I REALLY do not like a person that continues to push\/pull another person when you know they have genuine feelings for you. Either grow a pair and end things or get over your ridiculous parent issues and take a chance. It\u2019s just straight up mean and hurtful to lead someone on as Sage did to Lukas. Now she does get somewhat more likable in the second half of the book, but unfortunately I just never warmed up to her totally and was ultimately left feeling that Lukas deserved a better heroine.<br \/><br \/>Overall though this was an enjoyable and fast paced read and I look forward to seeing what this author has up next for us. Two thumbs up from yours truly. <br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>",

        "description":"In this moving account of loss, a boy takes a walk in the woods and makes a discovery that changes his understanding of his father.\r\n\r\nweek after the funeral\r\nI stare in the morning mirror\r\nAngry that my father\u2019s eyes\r\nStare back at me.\r\n\r\nConfused and distraught after the death of his father, a boy opens an envelope he left behind and is surprised to find a map of the woods beyond their house, with one spot marked in bright red. But why? The woods had been something they shared together, why would his father want him to go alone? \r\n\r\nSlowly, his mind settles as he sets off through the spaces he once explored with his dad, passing familiar beech and black oak trees, flitting Carolina wrens, and a garter snake they named Sal. When he reaches the spot marked on the map, he finds pages upon pages of drawings of woodland creatures, made by his father when he was his age. What he sees shows him a side of his dad he never knew, and something even deeper for them to share together. His dad knew what he really needed was a walk in the woods.\r\n\r\nNew York Times bestselling author Nikki Grimes and the Caldecott Award winning illustrator Jerry Pinkney spent the early days of the pandemic emailing back and forth and talking about collaborating on a book, with Jerry sharing all of the pictures he took of the woods around his house. From this, they conjured a story of a boy\u2019s struggle with grief, and all the things he sees and feels on a walk through the forest.\r\n\r\nJerry sadly passed away in the fall of 2021, but not before he delivered tight pencil sketches of the forests he loved. When his son Brian took on the task of completing the illustrations, he found himself connecting with his father in a whole new way, his experience mirroring that of the boy in the book. The result is a simultaneously touching and deeply authentic story about the ways shared pastimes keep us close to those we\u2019ve lost.\r\nSource: [penguinrandomhouse.com](https:\/\/www.penguinrandomhouse.com\/books\/727087\/a-walk-in-the-woods-by-nikki-grimes-illustrated-by-jerry-pinkney-and-brian-pinkney\/)",

        "description":"Winner of the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for poetry, Natasha Trethewey's elegiac *Native Guard* is a deeply personal volume that brings together two legacies of the Deep South.\r\n\r\nThe title of the collection refers to the Mississippi Native Guards, a black regiment whose role in the Civil War has been largely overlooked by history. As a child in Gulfport, Mississippi, in the 1960s, Trethewey could gaze across the water to the fort on Ship Island where Confederate captives once were guarded by black soldiers serving the Union cause. The racial legacy of the South touched Trethewey's life on a much more immediate level, too. Many of the poems in *Native Guard* pay loving tribute to her mother, whose marriage to a white man was illegal in her native Mississippi in the 1960s. Years after her mother's tragic death, Trethewey reclaims her memory, just as she reclaims the voices of the black soldiers whose service has been all but forgotten.",

Rachel and Drew Snow may be sisters, but their lives have followed completely different paths. Married to a wonderful man and is a mother to two strong-minded teens, Rachel hasn't returned to her childhood home since being kicked out by her strict father after an act of careless teenage rebellion. Drew, her younger sister, followed her passion for music but takes side jobs to make ends meet and longs for the stability that has always eluded her. Both sisters recall how close they were, but the distance between them seems more than they can bridge. When their deferential Japanese mother, Haruki, is diagnosed with dementia and gives Rachel power of attorney, Rachel's domineering father, Killian becomes enraged. In a rare moment of lucidity, Haruki asks Rachel for a book in her sewing room, and Rachel enlists her sister's help in the search. The book-which tells the tale of real-life female samurai Tomoe Gozen, an epic saga of love, loss, and conflict during twelfth-century Japan-reveals truths about Drew and Rachel's relationship that resonate across the centuries, connecting them in ways that turn their differences into assets\"--\n\n\"Margaret Dilloway, critically-acclaimed and award-winning author of How To Be An American Housewife, returns with a poignant story of estranged sisters reunited when a mysterious request from their ailing mother reveals a long-buried family secret\"--",

                "comment":"<p><br \/><br \/> <br \/><br \/>I like this cover. It\u2019s a good representation of the heroine (story). Good use of graphics. Good composition and interesting title work (although the OCD graphic designer in me is annoyed the \u201cE\u201d in the title goes off page. Thus making it not completely centered. <em>lol<\/em>) <br \/><br \/>So where do I star with this one? I rather enjoyed it immensely, to be honest. Although it did have a few issues that lowered my rating somewhat.<br \/><br \/>Let us start with what worked for me. I thought it was well written and (fairly) well paced. I loved the fabulous cast of secondary characters. Finally, a family that isn\u2019t hellbent on keeping the heroine\/hero apart with the standard <i>you can\u2019t date my little sister\/daughter, etc.<\/i> Everyone was very supportive of the relationship even when they were still young. Even when Evan had hurt Carys, they understood he had his reasons. There was no OW drama. There was a little bit of OM drama. I wouldn\u2019t say this was terribly angsty either.<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>Both main characters were likable (for the most part) I ADORED Evan even if he did have a bit of a martyr complex. He was always making decisions for others when he should have been including them. His heart was in the right place though so I didn\u2019t hold it against him (much). What I especially loved was this hero remained a virgin because he had feelings for the heroine (he did date, kiss, fool around with girls when he was in high school) because the heroine was three years younger than him and therefore still very young. They officially become boyfriend\/girlfriend when she is 15, and he is 18 and from that point on there is never even a thought of an OW for Evan. Carys I liked a tiny bit less. She came off childish at some points. But she was still young, so I understood where she was coming from. My biggest problem was I found her wishy-washy behavior with Greg annoying. Now usually in my second chance romances, I prefer they both move on, or they both stay celibate. In this one, the heroine does move on and has sex with her boyfriend. Considering the way Evan broke up with her and the fact that it did take her two and a half years to move on (Evan was gone three years). It was completely understandable IMO. She had NO idea if she would ever see him again or if he was even alive. She was trying to get on with her life.<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>So what didn\u2019t work for me? I thought maybe this one was a <i>smidge too long.<\/i> It did drag for me in a few places. It also hops back a forth in time A LOT. Which I am not a fan of, to begin with. Now I realize we needed that background information so we could feel how deeply this couple loved each other but I think the flashbacks of them as kids and teenagers could have been pared down. Which brings me to my other issue. The timeline was a bit odd (for lack of a better word). We see them as kids. We see scenes when she is 16, and he is 19 and going off to join the army. We see them again when he is back three years later (after he hasn\u2019t seen her in all that time). They finally <spoiler>lose their virginity to each other 19\/22<\/spoiler> The now takes place when the hero is 35 and the heroine 32. So he ended things when he was 32, and she was 29. What we don\u2019t get is really any information about what they were doing relationship wise in those ten years? We get a few details of Evan career path. Ten years is a LONG time. I would have expected them to at the very least be engaged by that point. I would have preferred fewer kid flashbacks and maybe some of how there were during that ten year period.<br \/><br \/>Wow, so apparently I had a lot to say about this one. <em>lol<\/em> Please excuse the book length review. I did enjoy this one a lot and definitely, recommend it and I can\u2019t wait to read Coop\u2019s story! Two thumbs up from yours truly.<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>",

        "description":"An extraordinary new writer makes her literary debut with this suspenseful novel of desire, obsession, power and vulnerability, in which a crisis of inheritance leads to the downfall of a wealthy family of Persian Jews in early twentieth-century Iran. For all his wealth and success, Asher Malacouti\u2014the head of a prosperous Jewish family living in the Iranian town of Kermanshah\u2014cannot have the one thing he desires above all: a male son. His young wife Rakhel, trapped in an oppressive marriage at a time when a woman\u2019s worth is measured by her fertility, is made desperate by her failure to conceive, and grows jealous and vindictive. Her despair is compounded by her sister-in-law Khorsheed\u2019s pregnancy and her husband\u2019s growing desire for Kokab, his cousin\u2019s wife. Frustrated by his wife\u2019s inability to bear him an heir, Asher makes a fateful choice that will shatter the household and drive Rakhel to dark extremes to save herself and preserve her status within the family. Witnessed through the memories of the family\u2019s only surviving daughter, Mahboubeh, now an elderly woman living in Los Angeles, The Girl from the Garden unfolds the complex, tragic history of her family in a long-lost Iran of generations past. Haunting, suspenseful and inspired by events in the author\u2019s own family, it is an evocative and poignant exploration of sacrifice, betrayal, and the indelible legacy of the families that forge us.",

Toklas Cook Book.\u201d \u2014Eula Biss, New York Times bestselling author of Having and Being Had A beautiful new edition of the classic culinary memoir by Alice B. Toklas, Gertrude Stein\u2019s romantic partner, with a new introduction by beloved culinary voice Ruth Reichl. Restaurant kitchens have long been dominated by men, but, as of late, there has been an explosion of interest in the many women chefs who are revolutionizing the culinary game. And, alongside that interest, an accompanying appetite for smart, well-crafted culinary memoirs by female trailblazers in food. Nearly 70 years earlier, there was Alice. When Alice B. Toklas was asked to write a memoir, she initially refused. Instead, she wrote The Alice B. Toklas Cook Book, a sharply written, deliciously rich cookbook memorializing meals and recipes shared by Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Wilder, Matisse, and Picasso\u2014and of course by Alice and Gertrude themselves. While The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas\u2014penned by Gertrude Stein\u2014adds vivid detail to Alice\u2019s life, this cookbook paints a richer, more joyous depiction: a celebration of a lifetime in pursuit of culinary delights. In this cookbook, Alice supplies recipes inspired by her travels, accompanied by amusing tales of her and Gertrude\u2019s lives together. In \u201cMurder in the Kitchen,\u201d Alice describes the first carp she killed, after which she immediately lit up a cigarette and waited for the police to come and haul her away; in \u201cDishes for Artists,\u201d she describes her hunt for the perfect recipe to fit Picasso\u2019s peculiar diet; and, of course, in \u201cRecipes from Friends,\u201d she provides the recipe for \u201cHaschich Fudge,\u201d which she notes may often be accompanied by \u201cecstatic reveries and extensions of one\u2019s personality on several simultaneous planes.\u201d With a heartwarming introduction from Gourmet\u2019s famed Editor-in-Chief Ruth Reichl, this much-loved, culinary classic is sure to resonate with food lovers and literary folk alike.",

Within the confines of her world, a patriarchal cult known as the Den, female fertility and sexuality are wholly controlled by Men. In the season they come of age, Sable and her friends Mamie and Dinah are each paired with a Match with the purpose of conceiving a child. Sable is paired with Ambrose, the son of a favoured Man in the Den. Others are not so lucky. In their second trimester, girls are sent to the Birth Yard, where they are prepared for giving birth and motherhood, but are also regularly drugged and monitored by their midwives. Sable is unable to ignore her unease about the pills they are forced to swallow and the punishments they receive for stepping out of line. Too many of the girls, including Mamie and Dinah, have secrets and it is impossible to know whom to trust. When Sable\u2019s loyalty is questioned and her safety within the Den is threatened, she must rebel against the only life she has ever known\u2014the only life she has been designed for. Mallory Tater weaves an intricate narrative, equal parts suspense and action, while twisting contemporary social anxieties to dizzying extremes. She meticulously deconstructs the intricate relationships between womanhood, government and the female body. A startling and important debut novel, The Birth Yard echoes Margaret Atwood\u2019s dark and cautionary classic The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. But this is no dystopian world; there is no totalitarian government. The Den exists now.",

Annina arrives in Venice in the winter of 1722 in hopes of studying with the great Venetian priest-violinist and opera impresario Antonio Vivaldi, known as the \"Red Priest\" because of his fiery red hair. But on her arrival she discovers that he has left for Rome. Her dream of singing in the opera is further hindered by family problems, a disparaging singing master, a malicious rival singer, a noble patron who becomes a sexual predator, and a mysterious Gypsy's prediction that she will suffer much and be silenced.

The divorce left her alone, with nothing but a set of car keys and 50% of a paltry savings account. So when the lifeless body of her former husband is discovered in the birch grove outside Dove's apartment on what would have been their fifth wedding anniversary, investigators waste no time making Dove a person of interest. She swears she didn't do it. She's never so much as killed a spider in her thirty-four years. But as evidence mounts against her, Dove finds herself questioning her memory, her sanity, and finally-her innocence.",

The Imperial Harem, Constantinople, 1579: Hannah and Isaac Levi, Venetians in exile, have set up a new life for themselves in Constantinople. Isaac runs a newly established business in the growing silk trade, while Hannah, the best midwife in all of Constantinople, plies her trade within the opulent palace of Sultan Murat III, tending to the thousand women of his lively and infamous harem. But one night, when Hannah is unexpectedly summoned to the palace, she's confronted with Zofia, a poor Jewish peasant girl who has been abducted and sold into the sultan's harem. The sultan favors her as his next conquest and wants her to produce his heir, but the girl just wants to return to her home and the only life she has ever known. Will Hannah risk her life and livelihood to protect this young girl, or will she prioritize her high esteem in the eye of the sultan?

How do the wise decide and lead businesses and organizations to great success is the question Bryn Zeckhauser and Aaron Sandoski posed to themselves after landing their first jobs as managers. Despite the best training the world could offer--Harvard MBAs and stints at McKinsey & Company, the elite powerhouse consulting firm--they felt unprepared when faced with the pressure to make critical decisions. So they set out on a three-year quest to discover how people with remarkable success and experience in both corporate and public life--\"the wise\"--went about making crucial, often make-or-break decisions. - How did William George, when CEO of Medtronic, get the real story about why a critical tool used by cardiologists was failing and use that information to fix a systemic problem within the company?- When inventor Dean Kamen has to make a decision about investing in a new technology, why does he find it useful to \"fill a room with barbarians\" to get the best thinking from his team?- How did Shelly Lazarus assess the risks of making a nontraditional career move, a decision that eventually led her to being appointed CEO? - How did Stephen Schwarzman and Peter Peterson, the founders of The Blackstone Group, turn $400,000 of their own money into one of the world's preeminent alternative asset managers with $100 billion under management?These and the other accounts of the direct conversations Zeckhauser and Sandoski had with twenty-one major leaders show that between wise decisions and poor ones lie vast fortunes and extraordinary contrasts in success. How the Wise Decide distills their wisdom, and it reveals how you can use this wisdom to be on the winning side of the ledger.From the Hardcover edition.",

        "description":"An exploration of \u201cmind design\u201d technologies and practices--mindapps--that boost intellectual capacity and enable new ways of thought and action \u2022 Reveals how mindapps transform the patterns of our mind-body complex and help generate new ideas by enabling access to new mind states \u2022 Examines the singlestate fallacy--the myth that useful thinking only occurs in our ordinary awake mental state \u2022 Explores a wealth of mindapp practices and techniques, including microdosing with psychedelics, yoga and martial arts, hypnosis, breathing techniques, lucid dreaming, rites of passage, biofeedback and neurofeedback, and transcranial brain stimulation Just as we can write and install apps in our electronic devices, we can construct \u201cmindapps\u201d and install them in our brain-mind complex, and as just as digital apps add capabilities to our devices, mindapps can expand our mental powers and creative abilities, allowing us to intentionally redesign our minds. Using psychedelics as the prime example, Thomas B. Roberts explores the many different kinds of mindapps, including meditation, other psychoactive plants and chemicals, sensory overload and deprivation, biofeedback and neurofeedback, hypnosis and suggestion, sleep and lucid dreaming, creative imagery, transcranial brain stimulation and optical brain stimulation, rites of passage, martial arts and exercise routines, yoga, breathing techniques, and contemplative prayer. He also looks at the future of mindapps, the potential for new mindapps yet to be invented, and how installing multiple mindapps can produce new, yet to be explored mind states. Drawing on decades of research, he shows how psychedelics in particular are \u201cideagens\u201d--powerful tools for generating new ideas and new ways of thinking. Uniting the many forms of mindapps into one overall Multistate Mind Theory, Roberts examines the singlestate fallacy--the myth that useful thinking only occurs in our ordinary awake mental state--and demonstrates the many mind-body states we are capable of. He shows how mindapps not only allow us to design and redesign our own minds but also offer benefits for artistic performance, mystical and spiritual experience, and scientific research by improving creativity, open-mindedness, problem solving, and inner-brain connections. Reformulating how we think about the human mind, Mindapps unveils the new multistate landscape of the mind and how we can each enter the world of mind design.",

Taking the philosophical concepts outlined in his earlier book, \"This Time the World,\" Rockwell distilled his political message into a hard-hitting, easy-to-read volume which is guaranteed to leave the reader shaken, despite having first been published in 1966. In 1958, alone and without funds, he hung up the Swastika and founded the first openly National Socialist organization anywhere in the world after the end of the Second World War. Using dramatic street tactics, uniforms and planned publicity stunts, Rockwell soon attracted worldwide attention and a small band of followers across America. Rockwell's highpoint came with a 3,000-strong rally at Marquette Park in Chicago in August 1966. Just as Rockwell seemed to pose a credible political threat, he was assassinated in August 1967, just a few months after this book was first published.",

Eight years ago, Grace McMullen broke Sutton Whitlock's heart when she walked away. But it was only to save him from the baggage of her own troubled past. Now all she wants is to make sure he's okay. Only everything she learns about him online says otherwise. According to his social media accounts, he placed roots in her hometown, married a look-alike, and even named his daughter Grace. He clearly hasn't moved on. In fact, it's creepy. So Grace does what any concerned ex-girlfriend would do: she moves home...and watches him. But when Grace crosses paths with Sutton's wife, Campbell, an unexpected friendship develops. Campbell has no idea whom she's inviting into her life. As the women grow closer, it becomes clear to Grace that Sutton is not the sentimental man she once knew. He seems controlling, unstable, and threatening. And what a broken man like Sutton is capable of, Grace can only imagine. It's up to her to save Campbell and her baby now--but while she's been watching them, who's been watching her?",

After a failed eight-year relationship and a cross-country move, the last thing I'm looking for as a single mom is a new flame. In fact, diapers, walls marked in crayon, and daycare pickup are the only things on my to-do list. Enter Jake Brady, your friendly neighborhood food truck owner whose dimples and delicacies won't seem to leave well enough alone. With more popularity than the president, his wine-infused sweet treats have our nation's capital hooked. He's spontaneous, smug and all-American gorgeous; a dangerous combination considering he has no interest in taking on the responsibilities that rule my life. But when we can't seem to sample enough of each other's ... desserts, things start to get complicated. Jake is biting off more than he can chew, and when I watch him with my daughter, I can't seem to freeze my melting heart. Maybe it's his waffle cone. Maybe it's his ... banana split.

He just knows I\u2019m quick to snappy book decisions and I had just DNF\u2019d a previous 4 books in a row prior to this one. <br \/><br \/>So, I read it.

For example, right before a big confrontation Harlan goes on a long sidebar on the science around why people think time slows down during intense moments then during the confrontation describes our characters doing just that. There was no need for the science lesson. It ruined the flow.  Similar situations though out the book. I listened to audiobook and I bet you could cut an hour out and not miss a beat.<\/p>",

                "comment":"<p>\u00a0So, this wasn???t a bad overview of the concept of monarchy as it applies to the UK, which, arguably, has the most famous and most popular monarchy in the world at the moment. Mitchell digs into how UK monarchy got set up in the first place, and where its roots actually lie: not in anything so grand as the legend of King Arthur or in the divine right of kings, but just people trying to cobble together a (relatively) sensible government out of anarchy. He argues that this might apply to monarchy in general, as a system, and therefore any crowned heads of state do not really deserve the immense respect they are granted in the present day. He aims this at the current UK royal family, but I can see this extending to other current monarchies elsewhere, and not just in Europe.  <br \/>One thing that might not sit right with readers is the author???s politics. He considers himself left-of-center, but there are moments when his stance will either chafe at the reader, or enrage entirely. I also suspect some readers might think he???s too cynical in parts, while others might argue he???s not being cynical enough. I personally found his stances mostly tolerable, though there were moments when they made me a mite twitchy.  <br \/>Overall, this wasn???t a bad read; the author???s done his research, and he lays out the history of the early UK monarchy in a way that I found entertaining and interesting enough to get through. However, he???s also very clear about his politics, so YMMV on whether or not you can tolerate his writing.\u00a0<\/p>",

While in some proofs without words an equation or two may appear to help guide that process, the emphasis is clearly on providing visual clues to stimulate mathematical thought. The proofs in this collection are arranged by topic into five chapters: geometry and algebra; trigonometry, calculus and analytic geometry; inequalities; integer sums; and sequences and series. Teachers will find that many of the proofs in this collection are well suited for classroom discussion and for helping students to think visually in mathematics.",

As communication is a very broad topic, the focus will be on the theoretical framework of Edward Hall differentiating between high-context and lowcontext communication. The objective is to compare German and Chinese culture and their way of communicating for the purpose of identifying similarities and differences, but also to clarify the impact of cultural differences and afterwards be able to superiorly deal with cultural differences in communication. This gives rise to the following research questions: How does communication between German and Chinese culture differ and what problems could arise as a consequence? What should be considered to successfully communicate with people of other cultures?",

His story resonated with me on a level that might not be really warranted by the book itself but it is what it is. There are things that could be criticized here, but they\u2019re mostly points of detail in my opinion, and they didn\u2019t stop me enjoying the book tremendously. <br \/>A point that might seem strange to some but is worthy of mention for me is that Durgin managed to have fat characters in a way that didn\u2019t come across as unnecessarily fatphobic something that I find very few authors manage successfully. <br \/>One last thing, John, I need you to get back to the writing desk and write Henry\u2019s story, that bleak grimness is begging to be written!<\/p>",

Then Iris, her young competitor, made a stunning leap in skill and turned Chime's world upside down.  Now no longer the most powerful, no longer promised to a prince -- and still unable to harness her magic properly -- Chime was set adrift. As was the new king's cousin -- and former heir -- Lord Muller. Yet when the neighboring kingdom threatened war, Muller and Chime were tasked with uncovering the plot. Both were flawed, yet unwilling to accept a lesser destiny than they had once known. Could this quest be the opportunity for redemption -- or would it lead them to their deaths? Award-winning author Catherine Asaro, creator of The Skolian Empire, creates her first full-length fantasy novel in a world rich with magic and power. Fans who caught a glimpse of the kingdom of Aronsdale in \"Moonglow\" from the Charmed Destinies collection are delighted with the result!",

I am not crazy about the way the title is done, and it\u2019s pretty generic in terms of being a representative of the story, but I have certainly seen worse covers. <br \/><br \/> This one was just OK for me. I enjoyed the first two books in this series, but this one fell a little short. Most of the blame lands squarely at the feet of the hero who I could not stand AT ALL. I mean I like asshole heroes a lot, but you need to show me that underneath the asshole he has some softness. This guy was just a straight up douchecanoe for most of the book. On top of that, the dead ex was mentioned WAY too much. Katie this and Katie that\u2026blah blah blah. Dude admits himself he didn\u2019t even know anything about the chick, yet goes on and on like she was the love of his life. Lastly, I found this one repetitive.<br \/><br \/> <br \/><br \/>On the positive side, I liked Katie. I do wish she would have told the hero to go f@ck himself on occasion, but overall she was a likable heroine. I also thought the sex scenes were fairly hot and I shed a few tears near the end. So it wasn\u2019t ALL bad.<br \/><br \/>Side Note: WTF happened to her father? Either I missed the part where they talked about what would be happening to him, or we were left hanging with no resolution to that particular issue.<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>",

                "comment":"<p>So volume 3 is more of the disjointed \u201cpreludes\u201d to the titular Age of Darkness. We see the Dark Queen extend her dominion to the Realms of Olympus (retired Gods apparently), Wonderland, and Oz. If you haven\u2019t read the Wonderland and Oz arcs (like me), then things are more disjointed than usual, since I don\u2019t know who most of these characters are. The artwork in the entirety of this volume is pretty good; all three issues had different art styles.<br \/><br \/>Taken by themselves, the weakest story is definitely the first one. \u201cGodstorm\u201d gives you a look at the current state of Zeus and his brothers. I didn\u2019t even realise Gods of Olympus were involved in the Grimm fairy tales world. It\u2019s not a particularly deep story, so it feels like I was reading an epilogue with no real clue about what had happened. Wonderland is the second issue, which does attempt to provide a bit of recap so you can sort of build an impression of who the two ladies are. The last issue on Oz is similar to Wonderland, in that it shows you what had come to pass, before bringing it all to a dark end.<br \/><br \/>I guess all this is again meant to be building up to some big event. But with the amount of different places and different times this Dark Queen keeps travelling to, it certainly feels like she\u2019s taking her own sweet time to personally make things happen, with so many villains probably just waiting for her to finish her plane hopping and get back to the actual invasion.<\/p>",

It sets out to describe the whole spectrum of the astrological tradition in England on the eve of its eclipse. The study focuses on the 17th century's premier practitioner, William Lilly. The author reveals him as an astrological leveller, the first to initiate readers into this ancient art. She traces through Lilly's work the major diagnostic categories of comets, eclipses, mock suns, and the historiography of conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn as well as multifaceted astrological enciphering, showing how Lilly exploited this knowledge to deploy astrology's entire arsenal in justifying the defeat and beheading of England's annointed sovereign, Charles I. In doing so the book attempts to show the innate function of astrology as a language and universal explanatory system, and to offer an explanation for the decline of astrology.",

In this investigative tour-de-force, Trey Garrison and Richard McClure delve into the human stories behind the epidemic which has killed over 400,000 Americans since 1999 and destroyed the lives of millions more. Down winding roads and up beautiful mountains, the journey into this modern heart of darkness is narrated with grim detail and interspersed with research giving systemic context to personal stories. Throughout it all, rays of light shine through in these accounts of the courage, perseverance, and dignity of those who have overcome or are fighting back against a force so much stronger than themselves out of love for their people. Well-sourced and hard hitting, this book is a must have for anyone who wants to learn more about the sad state of the forgotten man. At a time when good journalism is the exception to the rule, especially when the victims are rural Whites, these authors provide a sobering look into the Opioid Epidemic. Antelope Hill is proud to present Trey Garrison and Richard McClure's Opioids for the Masses, the true story of an America that has been forgotten and betrayed.",

The summary was extremely misleading, which is a huge pet peeve of mine.  One of the things that I didn\u2019t like about this book was that it always felt like something was <i>about<\/i> to happen.  But nothing really ever did.  There was all this (really subtle, relying on guesswork) build up around the supposed love triangle, and by the end, I honestly <i>didn\u2019t care<\/i> about the romance.  Not a bit.  I honestly think I would have enjoyed the story more without it (aaand there was the sound of jaws dropping around the world because YES, I JUST SAID THAT).  My favorite thing about this book is how McVoy sneaks up on you with some original, lyrical turns of phrase you totally aren\u2019t expecting.  It kind of reminded me of Elizabeth Scott.  I also think Char was an interesting character, and I liked reading about her, her friendships, and the whole band element.<\/p>",

To ex-detective John Barnes, the machine is a dangerous and abhorrent addiction. The criminal thoughts it embedded in his brain helped him stop a serial killer, but they left him dazed--with pounding, murderous impulses. Having turned in his badge to salvage what's left of his psyche, Barnes must return to the darkness at the request of his former partner. A little girl has gone missing. So has Adrian Flaherty, the detective in the kidnapper's shadow. And only Barnes can hear the clues. But the trail is more dizzying and more personal than he feared. The voices are revealing a secret only Flaherty could have known. They're also telling Barnes that he doesn't have long to live. To find the girl, he must listen closely. Because the clock is ticking...and Barnes's mind is going fast.",

        "description":"A scientist reveals the groundbreaking evidence linking many major diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease, to a common root cause\u2014insulin resistance\u2014and shares an easy, effective plan to reverse and prevent it. We are sick. Around the world, we struggle with diseases that were once considered rare. Cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, and diabetes affect millions each year; many people are also struggling with hypertension, weight gain, fatty liver, dementia, low testosterone, menstrual irregularities and infertility, and more. We treat the symptoms, not realizing that all of these diseases and disorders have something in common. Each of them is caused or made worse by a condition known as insulin resistance. And you might have it. Odds are you do\u2014over half of all adults in the United States are insulin resistant, with most other countries either worse or not far behind. In Why We Get Sick, internationally renowned scientist and pathophysiology professor Benjamin Bikman explores why insulin resistance has become so prevalent and why it matters. Unless we recognize it and take steps to reverse the trend, major chronic diseases will be even more widespread. But reversing insulin resistance is possible, and Bikman offers an evidence-based plan to stop and prevent it, with helpful food lists, meal suggestions, easy exercise principles, and more. Full of surprising research and practical advice, Why We Get Sick will help you to take control of your health.",

        "publicationYear":2011,
        "description":"The renowned architectural photographer shares seven decades\u2019 worth of images of the city he loved, celebrated, and made iconic. With a life and career spanning nearly a century, Julius Shulman is credited with furthering the midcentury modernism movement through his flawless photographs of the pioneering architecture of Richard Neutra and Charles Eames, among others. While Shulman\u2019s pictures comprise the most published images of the modernist movement, this new monograph presents many never-before-seen images on a subject closest to Shulman\u2019s heart: Los Angeles and its environs\u2014including Palm Springs and other suburbs. These affecting photographs show Los Angeles as a living organism, simultaneously vibrant and volatile depending on the neighborhood. This tension is apparent in Shulman\u2019s documentation of then-emerging areas like Century City, Wilshire Boulevard, and Echo Park, as well as his studies of landmarks like the Watts Towers and Grauman\u2019s Chinese Theatre. Many of the Los Angeles buildings and neighborhoods photographed by Shulman have since been overhauled, torn down, or otherwise altered beyond recognition, making these images some of the only lasting testaments to their existence. Selected from his personal collection as well as his official archives, the photographs included in this book represent not only lesser-known and never-before-seen material, but also some of Shulman\u2019s own personal favorites.",

        "publicationYear":2008,
        "description":"The Strong Man is the first full-scale biography of John N. Mitchell, the central figure in the rise and ruin of Richard Nixon and the highest-ranking American official ever convicted on criminal charges.As U.S. attorney general from 1969 to 1972, John Mitchell stood at the center of the upheavals of the late sixties. The most powerful man in the Nixon cabinet, a confident troubleshooter, Mitchell championed law and order against the bomb-throwers of the antiwar movement, desegregated the South's public schools, restored calm after the killings at Kent State, and steered the commander-in-chief through the Pentagon Papers and Joint Chiefs spying crises. After leaving office, Mitchell survived the ITT and Vesco scandals--but was ultimately destroyed by Watergate. With a novelist's skill, James Rosen traces Mitchell's early life and career from his Long Island boyhood to his mastery of Wall Street, where Mitchell's innovations in municipal finance made him a power broker to the Rockefellers and mayors and governors in all fifty states. After merging law firms with Richard Nixon, Mitchell brilliantly managed Nixon's 1968 presidential campaign and, at his urging, reluctantly agreed to serve as attorney general. With his steely demeanor and trademark pipe, Mitchell commanded awe throughout the government as Nixon's most trusted adviser, the only man in Washington who could say no to the president.Chronicling the collapse of the Nixon presidency, The Strong Manfollows America's former top cop on his singular odyssey through the criminal justice system--a tortuous maze of camera crews, congressional hearings, special prosecutors, and federal trials. The path led, ultimately, to a prison cell in Montgomery, Alabama, where Mitchell was welcomed into federal custody by the same men he had appointed to office. Rosen also reveals the dark truth about Mitchell's marriage to the flamboyant and volatile Martha Mitchell: her slide into alcoholism and madness, their bitter divorce, and the toll it all took on their daughter, Marty.Based on 250 original interviews and hundreds of thousands of previously unpublished documents and tapes, The Strong Manresolves definitively the central mysteries of the Nixon era: the true purpose of the Watergate break-in, who ordered it, the hidden role played by the Central Intelligence Agency, and those behind the cover-up.A landmark of history and biography, The Strong Manis that rarest of books: both a model of scholarly research and savvy analysis and a masterful literary achievement.",

        "title":"Finding Lost Space: Theories of Urban Design",
        "publicationYear":1986,
        "description":"The problem of \"lost space,\" or the inadequate use of space, afflicts most urban centers today. The automobile, the effects of the Modern Movement in architectural design, urban-renewal and zoning policies, the dominance of private over public interests, as well as changes in land use in the inner city have resulted in the loss of values and meanings that were traditionally associated with urban open space. This text offers a comprehensive and systematic examination of the crisis of the contemporary city and the means by which this crisis can be addressed. Finding Lost Space traces leading urban spatial design theories that have emerged over the past eighty years: the principles of Sitte and Howard; the impact of and reactions to the Functionalist movement; and designs developed by Team 10, Robert Venturi, the Krier brothers, and Fumihiko Maki, to name a few. In addition to discussions of historic precedents, contemporary approaches to urban spatial design are explored. Detailed case studies of Boston, Massachusetts; Washington, D.C.; Goteborg, Sweden; and the Byker area of Newcastle, England demonstrate the need for an integrated design approach--one that considers figure-ground, linkage, and place theories of urban spatial design. These theories and their individual strengths and weaknesses are defined and applied in the case studies, demonstrating how well they operate in different contexts. This text will prove invaluable for students and professionals in the fields of architecture, landscape architecture, and city planning. Finding Lost Space is going to be a primary text for the urban designers of the next generation. It is the first book in the field to absorb the lessons of the postmodern reaction, including the work of the Krier brothers and many others, and to integrate these into a coherent theory and set of design guidelines. Without polemics, Roger Trancik addresses the biggest issue in architecture and urbanism today: how can we regain in our shattered cities a public realm that is made of firmly shaped, coherently linked, humanly meaningful urban spaces?

It\u2019s a nice touch to tell some character back story while in the middle of an ambush, but the jumping around before, during, and after the ambush felt somewhat disjointed. The characters are a bit clich\u00e9 but given the nature of this dystopia, you can\u2019t really expect much more than that. <br \/><br \/>It\u2019s light on story and flavour because the pages never tried to give colour and reason to why the world is the way it is. No attempt at all except right at the beginning which sort gave it a vague history. No attempt to explain how the priesthood rose to become a militant order. It just is. Just like the ambush - it\u2019s just an ambush. There\u2019s no consequence at all, despite mention of tyres getting destroyed by caltrops. They still continued on their mission, which brought them to an army getting attacked by the vampires - why is there an army in no-man\u2019s land? Unexplained. It\u2019s just there for plot convenience to do some character development. <br \/><br \/>I really wanted to like this since I saw it by chance. I might get volume 2 if I ever see it, but it just feels like wasted opportunity to develop the world more. Granted, it\u2019s a movie prequel, but it could\u2019ve been more.<\/p>",

        "description":"Born to a Belgian family in the year 1906, L\u00e9on Joseph Marie Ignace Degrelle rose to prominence as a newspaper editor and head of the militant monarchist, Catholic, and anticommunist Parti Rexiste. Following the German occupation of Belgium, Degrelle and his party loyalists enlisted in the Wehrmacht-organized Walloon Legion to aid in the liberation of the peoples of the Soviet Republics. He raised approximately 6,000 volunteers over the course of the war, both for the Wehrmacht and, later, for the Waffen-SS. Barely a third of these volunteers would survive. Degrelle and his men were noted for extreme bravery, brutal ferocity in close quarters fighting, and an indomitable spirit of self-sacrifice, with Degrelle himself earning the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves. After the fall of Berlin, Degrelle made a daring escape from the crumbling Third Reich. He managed to reach Spain, where he was safeguarded by Franco's government. His native Belgium later sentenced him to death in absentia for collaboration with the Germans. Degrelle expressed no regrets for joining the war on the side of the Axis Powers, defending both his own actions and those of his superiors and comrades. He lived in Spain until his death of natural causes in 1994, and remained active in anticommunist and pan-European causes despite several attempts at his extradition, kidnapping, or assassination. The Burning Souls is Degrelle's reflection on his experiences and on the soul - part poetry, part memoir. In it, he traces his journey, from his idyllic childhood to the frozen steppes of Russia, not just as a physical journey but as a great spiritual trial. He instructs us that to give oneself completely, to be willing to weather all hardships in service of a transcendent ideal, is what is required to overcome the spiritual malaise of our day. The Burning Souls is now being made available for the first time in English by Antelope Hill Publishing.",

Rockwell describes his family background, his childhood, student days and his participation as a US Navy fighter pilot in World War II. It then moves on to describe his conversion to first conservatism and then into National Socialism, providing much of the evidence along the way which he found so convincing. He describes his two marriages, and the ups and downs of his personal life leading up to the time in 1958, when, alone and without a penny to his name, he hoisted a swastika flag in his house in Arlington, Virginia, and announced the launch of the first openly National Socialist party in America since 1945. In 1965, Rockwell polled 5,730 votes in a Virginia governor election, and in 1967 drew over 3,000 people to a public rally in Chicago. His increasing popularity frustrated opponents and it came as no surprise when he was gunned down just a few months after the publication of his second book, White Power.",

                "comment":"<p>I got highs and lows from this short story. The really enjoyable bits were the narration of the protagonist\u2019s hypersensitive ears as well as the imagination-vs-reality contrasting and rationalisation. The suspense was definitely there as it keeps you guessing just what\u2019s going to happen. And in typical Lovecraft fashion, the narration was from the Gilman\u2019s (protagonist) perspective, except for the final bits.<br \/><br \/>The plot was a bit slow, but I guess it was meant to build suspense, since it draws in the perspectives and reactions of the people around Gilman. One of the bits I didn\u2019t like was when Gilman was experiencing his \u201cdream\u201d states - the descriptions of these were just too surreal and not very well done, resulting in difficulty to picture things. Another slightly unrealistic bit, just to nitpick, was why didn\u2019t it occur to Gilman to just move out; it wasn\u2019t as if he was unsuspecting that something weird is going on.<br \/><br \/>Still, I enjoyed it, just like I enjoyed the rest. The \u201cmonsters\u201d in this one were a bit closer to home and much smaller in scale, bringing a different kind of eerie.<\/p>",

        "description":"Fearsome and provocative, the slogan \"Blood and Soil\" speaks to the interplay between the land and the people on it-the power of a land to shape a people and the power of a people to shape a land. Richard Walther Darr\u00e9, an Obergruppenf\u00fchrer in the SS, was the leading \"Blood and Soil\" ideologist of Germany and served his people as Reich Minister of Food and Agriculture. This book, A New Nobility of Blood and Soil, was massively popular in the Third Reich and led to a strengthening of the agrarian and agriculturalist movements. Highly influential on Hitler, the principles in this book are foundational to the National Socialist worldview. This worldview held that Germany's natural elite, its nobility of blood and soil, was the nation's last hope against both the rapacious elite of capitalist wealth and the degenerate elite of ancient privilege. The hardworking and industrious peasant, who has no other country to call home, no riches with which to escape his duties, no international connections with which to deracinate himself, is the truly national man. His country is everything to him, and he is everything to his country, for it is on his back and by his sweat that his country is built. Thus, only from such a class of people can a new nobility arise that can combat the depravations of the modern world, with its polluted rivers, childless marriages, and the asphalt culture of city life. With no English language edition available, this essential text has been unknown to modern dissidents for far too long. Antelope Hill Publishing is proud to present, for the first time in English, A New Nobility of Blood and Soil. Laboriously translated by Augusto Salan and Julius Sylvester, this book is important to the preservation and contextualization of history.",

Not only an astonishing work of art in its own right, the book comes with a fact sheet detailing important breakthroughs between 1957 and 1975.

She was there to photograph the artifacts collected by a highly secretive organization, founded two centuries earlier by an alchemist. And the alchemist's descendant-her employer, Gabriel Jones-has the eyes of a sorcerer.\r\n\r\nBut despite Venetia's intent to seduce Mr. Jones and move on, she is shattered upon her return home to read in the press of his violent demise. Using the sizable fee Mr. Jones paid her, Venetia establishes a new life, opening a gallery in London. Of course, posing as a respectable widow makes it easier to do business, so-in a private tribute to her lost, only lover-she assumes the identity of \"Mrs. Jones.\"\r\n\r\nHer romantic whim, however, will cause unexpected trouble. For one thing, Mr. Jones is about to stride, living and breathing, back into Venetia's life. And the two share more than a passionate memory-indeed, they are bonded by a highly unusual sort of vision, one that goes far beyond Venetia's abilities as a photographer. They also share a terrible threat-for someone has stolen a centuries-old notebook from Arcane House that contains a formula believed to enhance psychic powers of the kind Gabriel and Venetia possess. And the thief wants to know more-even if he must kill the keeper of the Arcane Society's treasures, or the photographer who catalogued them, to obtain such knowledge.",

        "description":"The author of the genre-defining memoir This Boy's Life, the PEN\/Faulkner Award--winning novella The Barracks Thief, and short stories acclaimed as modern classics, Tobias Wolff now gives us his first novel.Determined to fit in at his New England prep school, the narrator has learned to mimic the bearing and manners of his adoptive tribe while concealing as much as possible about himself. His final year, however, unravels everything he's achieved, and steers his destiny in directions no one could have predicted. The school's mystique is rooted in Literature, and for many boys this becomes an obsession, editing the review and competing for the attention of visiting writers whose fame helps to perpetuate the tradition. Robert Frost, soon to appear at JFK's inauguration, is far less controversial than the next visitor, Ayn Rand. But the final guest is one whose blessing a young writer would do almost anything to gain.No one writes more astutely than Wolff about the process by which character is formed, and here he illuminates the irresistible power, even the violence, of the self-creative urge. Resonant in ways at once contemporary and timeless, Old School is a masterful achievement by one of the finest writers of our time.From the Hardcover edition.",

Becoming the CEO of a multi-million-pound pet supply empire was not on Evelyn\u2019s horizon, but here she is. Battling a disgruntled board, fending off unreasonable budget requests, and catching her semi-serious girlfriend with another woman all before the dreaded festive season. What\u2019s so good about Christmas, anyway?\nAlyssa Fox is sick to death of her dog rescue centre, being used as a Christmas gift store. Don\u2019t these people know a dog is for life, not just for Christmas? Hell, there are TV adverts about it. No matter how many times she delivers the same speech to potential dog owners, those poor pups always end up right back where they started as soon as the shine wears off.\nWell, not this year! No, this year Alyssa has taken action. Four Paws Dog Rescue will close for two months, starting November 1st. Now Alyssa just has to come up with a way to keep her dogs from going crazy with boredom. Adoption might be off the table for the pack, but they still need socialising. Enter Crawford Pet Supplies. The answer to Alyssa\u2019s problem. A partnership with the company\u2019s HQ building in London is just the ticket. What could go wrong?\n\nIs it possible that the hard-to-pin-down Alyssa Fox has met her match?

Nice typography with an eye-catching title. The light blue on the B&amp;W background really makes it POP. It\u2019s also similar to book one and two so good unity within the series.<br \/><br \/> Although I enjoyed this final book it turned out to be my least favorite of the trio. I enjoyed the plot, and the writing and pace continued to both be excellent. Unfortunately, the romance aspect was lacking. In fact, if I am honest, I felt zero connection between Cam and Thea in this one right until the very end which had the effect of making the ending seem incredibly rushed. <br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>By the third book in a series (all featuring the same couple) their connection should feel solid to the reader. Of course, I expect it to be tested and things to happen, but behind that, there should be a solid base that has been forming over the course of all three books. That was missing in this one. This couple lost their spark. It kind of made me wish Cam would move on and find a better mate. I could not stand Thea which isn\u2019t a total surprise since I struggled with her through the previous two books. Yes, there are reasons she was behaving the way she was, but they didn\u2019t help me to feel differently towards her at all. All those feelings were exuberated by the fact that they were separated for two years. That was just WAY too long in my opinion, and I struggled to understand the necessity of having them apart for that length of time. <br \/><br \/>So yea, this one missed the mark a little for me but the series overall was really rather enjoyable, and I am looking forward to Zak and Amer\u2019s book!<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>",

        "description":"\u201cThe Limits to Growth\u201d (Meadows, 1972) generated unprecedented controversy with its predictions of the eventual collapse of the world's economies. First hailed as a great advance in science, \u201cThe Limits to Growth\u201d was subsequently rejected and demonized. However, with many national economies now at risk and global peak oil apparently a reality, the methods, scenarios, and predictions of \u201cThe Limits to Growth\u201d are in great need of reappraisal. In The Limits to Growth Revisited, Ugo Bardi examines both the science and the polemics surrounding this work, and in particular the reactions of economists that marginalized its methods and conclusions for more than 30 years. \u201cThe Limits to Growth\u201d was a milestone in attempts to model the future of our society, and it is vital today for both scientists and policy makers to understand its scientific basis, current relevance, and the social and political mechanisms that led to its rejection. Bardi also addresses the all-important question of whether the methods and approaches of \u201cThe Limits to Growth\u201d can contribute to an understanding of what happened to the global economy in the Great Recession and where we are headed from there.",

        "description":"In-depth and well-researched interviews with the leading minds in psychedelic science and culture \u2022 A curated collection of interviews with 15 accomplished scientists, artists, and thinkers, including Albert Hofmann, Stanislav Grof, Rick Strassman, and Charles Tart \u2022 Explores their profound reflections on the intersections between psychedelics and a wide range of topics, including psychology, creativity, music, the near-death experience, DNA, and the future of psychedelic drug medical research After many dark years of zealous repression, there are now more than a dozen government-approved clinical studies with psychedelics taking place around the globe. But what does the future hold for psychedelic research and the expansion of consciousness? In this curated collection of interviews with pioneers in psychedelic thought, David Jay Brown explores the future of mind-altering drugs, hallucinogenic plants, and the evolution of human consciousness. The accomplished scientists, artists, and thinkers interviewed in the book include LSD discoverer Albert Hofmann, psychologist Stanislav Grof, DMT researcher Rick Strassman, anthropologist Jeremy Narby, MAPS founder Rick Doblin, ethnobotanist Dennis McKenna, psychologist Charles Tart, and musician Simon Posford from Shpongle, as well as many others. Demonstrating deep knowledge of his interviewees\u2019 work, Brown elicits profound reflections from them as well as their considered opinions on the future of psychedelic drug medical research, God and the afterlife, LSD and mysticism, DMT research and non-human entity contact, problem-solving and psychedelics, ayahuasca and DNA, psilocybin and the religious experience, MDMA and PTSD, releasing the fear of death, the tryptamine dimension, the therapeutic potential of salvia, and the intersections between psychedelics and creativity, ecology, paranormal phenomena, and alternate realities. In each interview we discover how these influential minds were inspired by their use of entheogens. We see how psychedelics have the potential to help us survive as a species, not only by their therapeutic benefits but also by revealing our sacred connection to the biosphere and by prompting people to begin on the path of spiritual evolution.",

        "publicationYear":2019,
        "description":"From the age of 26 until his death in 1945, Joseph Goebbels kept a near-daily diary. In it, he recorded significant events of the day along with his thoughts and opinions on a variety of topics, most notably the Jewish policy of the Third Reich. Here we get a detailed and unprecedented look at the attitudes of one of the highest-ranking men in Nazi Germany. Goebbels shared Hitler's dislike of the Jews, and likewise wanted them totally removed from the Reich territory--this is the so-called \"territorial solution\" to the Jewish Question. The Jews would be collected into ghettos, disinfested of typhus-bearing lice, and then transported to newly-captured lands in the East. Once there, they would be detained in concentration camps or put to work as forced labor. Ultimately, Goebbels and others sought to remove the Jews completely from the Eurasian land mass--perhaps to central Africa or the island of Madagascar. This would be the \"final solution\" to the Jewish Question. As such, these entries have a profound effect on our understanding of the Holocaust. Nowhere in the diary does Goebbels discuss any Hitler order to kill the Jews, nor is there any reference to extermination camps, gas chambers, or any methods of systematic mass-murder. Goebbels acknowledges that Jews did indeed die by the thousands; but the range and scope of killings evidently fall far short of the claimed figure of 6 million. This book contains, for the first time, every significant diary entry relating to the Jews or Jewish policy. There are 178 such entries in all, in both English and German original. Entries are covered in chronological order, along with additional commentary and contextual remarks. Also included are partial or full citations of 10 major essays by Goebbels on the Jews, which bring important clarity to our understanding of his views. What emerges is a picture of an intelligent and highly-educated man who wanted the best for his German people, and who therefore had to grapple with what he saw as the primary threat to their well-being--the Jews.",

        "publicationYear":2024,
        "description":"Tracing the narratives of five incarcerated individuals, Sentenced to COVID speaks to the devastating impact of surviving the pandemic inside prison walls. Corridors of Contagion brings to light the experiences of five people incarcerated across the United States as they navigate the onset of the pandemic\u2014and the many months, stretched into years, that followed. Journalist Victoria Law combines this storytelling with a trenchant analysis of the structural failures of the US carceral system: failures that made prisons uniquely vulnerable to COVID-19 outbreaks, from overcrowding to solitary confinement, from insufficient healthcare to life sentences. The book portrays the horrors of continual lockdowns not in the comfort of one\u2019s own home, but in prisons where routine violence and chaos is made even more unimaginable by the complete lack of control over protection from a terrifying and lethal new virus. The pandemic provided an opportunity for lawmakers and policy makers to rethink the nation\u2019s addiction to perpetual punishment. Instead, US jails and prisons doubled down on punishment under the guise of pandemic protections. As a result, people behind bars experienced increased stress, mental health challenges, increased violence, and higher rates of deaths, many of which could have been prevented. While the pandemic emergency has been declared over, we are continuing to learn more about the extent of its destruction. Corridors of Contagion reminds readers about both the particular horrors experienced by people in cages and the continued role of the US as the world\u2019s prison nation.",

Now a private investigator, Hammons makes his living looking for missing persons--a plentiful caseload during the Great Depression, when people seem to disappear all the time. But his routine is disrupted when his brother--another homicide detective, still on the force--enlists his help looking into the death of a young woman whose dismembered body is found beside the railroad tracks. The sheriff rules it an accident, but the carnage is too neat, and the staging of the body parts too ritual. Hammons suspects it's the work of a \"lust murderer\"--similar to the serial strangler whose killing spree he had ended a few years earlier. But who was the poor girl, dressed demurely in pink? And why was his business card tucked into her small purse? As Hammons searches for the victim's identity, he discovers that the dead girl had some secrets of her own, and that the case is connected to some of Phoenix's most powerful citizens--on both sides of the law.",

        "description":"From the author of the best-selling A Venetian Affair (\u201cA narrative of novelistic resonance . . . Astonishing\u201d \u2014The Washington Post), the story of an Italian Renaissance book editor who introduced European minds to the wider world through his passion for geography In the autumn of 1550, a thick volume containing a wealth of geographical information new to Europeans, with startling wood-cut maps of Africa, India and Indonesia, was published in Venice under the title Navigationi et Viaggi (Journeys and Navigations). The editor of this remarkable collection of travelogues, journals and classified government reports remained anonymous. Two additional volumes delivered the most accurate information on Asia and the \u201cNew World\u201d available at the time. The three volumes together constituted an unparalleled release of geographical data into the public domain. It was, Andrea di Robilant writes, the biggest Wikileak of the Renaissance. In This Earthly Globe, di Robilant brings to life the palace intrigues, editorial wheedling, delicate alliances and vibrant curiosity that resulted in this coup by the editor Giovambattista Ramusio. Learned and self-effacing, he gathered a vast array of both popular and closely guarded narratives, from the journals of Marco Polo (he fact-checked them!) to detailed reports on Northern African cultures from the Muslim scholar and diplomat al-Hasan ibn Mohammad al-Wazzan (later known as Leo Africanus). Diverse voices spill out from these chapters as di Robilant recounts how Ramusio pursued the sources, and how he understood both the darker episodes of \u201cexploration\u201d involving colonial violence and the voyage stories which included accounts of people from African and Asian lands, who had a great deal to share about their cultures. The result is a far-flung and delightful homage to one of the founding fathers of modern geography.",

        "description":"This book is the definitive story of Amazon.com, one of the most successful companies in the world, and of its driven, brilliant founder, Jeff Bezos. Amazon.com started off delivering books through the mail. But its visionary founder, Jeff Bezos, wasn't content with being a bookseller. He wanted Amazon to become the everything store, offering limitless selection and seductive convenience at disruptively low prices. To do so, he developed a corporate culture of relentless ambition and secrecy that's never been cracked. Until now. Brad Stone enjoyed unprecedented access to current and former Amazon employees and Bezos family members, giving readers the first in-depth, fly-on-the-wall account of life at Amazon. Compared to tech's other elite innovators -- Jobs, Gates, Zuckerberg -- Bezos is a private man. But he stands out for his restless pursuit of new markets, leading Amazon into risky new ventures like the Kindle and cloud computing, and transforming retail in the same way Henry Ford revolutionized manufacturing. The Everything Store will be the revealing, definitive biography of the company that placed one of the first and largest bets on the Internet and forever changed the way we shop and read. - Publisher.",

        "description":"At once poetry, art and activism, Vicu\u00f1a's playful multimedia works \"open up minds by opening up words\" This beautifully designed clothbound book brings together the Palabrarmas series by the Chilean-born artist, poet and activist Cecilia Vicu\u00f1a (born 1948). Images of these works--each a powerful juxtaposition of color, poetry and politics--appear alongside new essays and historical references chosen with the artist. Palabrarmas, a neologism that translates to \"word weapons\" or \"word arms,\" imagine new ways of seeing language. Taking the form of collages, silkscreens, drawings, poems, fabric banners, cutouts, mixed-media installations and street actions, Vicu\u00f1a's Palabarmas bring together her work in poetry, activism and visual art. Each one unpacks and deconstructs single words to reveal other words hiding within them, allowing new meanings to emerge. The artist began making these visual anagrams while in exile in London and Bogot\u00e1 after the Pinochet-led coup of 1973 in Chile, and has always seen them as a form of liberation--as a way to \"open up minds by opening up words,\" as she puts it. The Palabarmas have taken on new relevance in today's political climate, and appeared on the streets during Chile's 2019 revolution as protest signs. This book presents a range of Palabrarmas in color for the first time, with new essays by M\u00f3nica de la Torre, Carla Macchiavello, Cecilia Vicu\u00f1a and Jeanne Gerrity, and reprinted texts by Ren\u00e9 Daumal, Robert Randall and Sim\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez.",

The bad is that it\u2019s not exactly about how to build a parser from the ground up. It\u2019s more about how to use the author\u2019s toolkit to produce one. So it\u2019s more useful to readers who want to build a simple scripting language than it is for readers wanting to actually build a parser.<\/p>",

Then, the novel kicks into high gear and you\u2019re in for a ride. <br \/><br \/>I loved the two leads. Emma was delightful. She reminds me of what Emily Prentiss and JJ would\u2019ve been like in their younger days. Travis Bell, reminds me a lot of Morgan. But none of these book characters are a one to one copies, which I\u2019m grateful for. <br \/><br \/>The book was lovely and gripping and thrilling. I loved it.<br \/><br \/>I think the author had written this really well as well showing that the characters have grown and learned from the experiences just within the book.

After reading the a good girls guide to murder series, I though I would never experience what I experienced reading that series. Like NEVER ever again. BUTTTTTT THIS BROUGHT ME BACK!!<br \/>I felt as if I was watching a criminal minds episode, but make it teenagers\u2026 and I little bit more graphic. I love to experience emotions while reading a book, and this one gave it all. I was feeling anxious, mostly scared, SAD, intrigued, and confused most of the time. And I was ALSO trying to figure out all the clues and everything that was going on. I read this in a day which I guess says it all. The way that I was genuinely scared of some of the people is unbelievable. Everytime Emma would interview Simon, I had an uneasy feeling in my stomach. I didn\u2019t wanted her, or anyone near him. The author did a really good job making him psychologically, mentally unstable, (for a teenager). I remembered one page that LITERALLY made my heart stop, just one sentence. I felt as if I WAS there. Overall I just won\u2019t be able to sleep, not because I\u2019m scared (which part of me is still traumatized), but because how GOOD this was.<br \/>ALSO I cried<\/p>",

It\u2019s probably one of my favorites by this author, and the whole setup of the story was unique. It was well written and nicely paced. No OM drama. A <i>tiny<\/i> bit of OW drama. No angst. It was kind of low on the heat scale, but that didn\u2019t take away from the story, and both characters were likable.<br \/><br \/> <br \/><br \/>Now, personally, I would have liked to have seen the drama drawn out a little bit more. I would have added a nice little bit of angst to the story and would have provided an opportunity for the hero to do some chasing and groveling. The ending felt a bit rushed, and forgiveness is given a little too quickly. But like I said, that\u2019s just a personal preference thing as the angst that setup could have created happens to be my favorite type of angst in my romance books. In any case, this still gets two thumbs up from yours truly.<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>",

        "description":"In Mysterious Sahara Prorok, a popular archeologist and adventurer of the time, describes his 1925-28 expeditions into north Africa. He goes south from Algeria, across the Sahara, and into the mountains of the Hoggar.The first chapter of this book is a rather grim but fascinating roll call of early Saharan explorers. The list goes on and on, and almost all of them died horribly. Sometimes it was thirst or hunger, but usually it was at the hands of the Taureg, the giant \"white\" race of the Sahara, in which the men wear veils and are dressed from head to toe in black. Prorok himself, throughout all of his books, keeps up a rather chipper tone, which diverts the reader from the fact that hundreds of explorers died in the very same tracks. This isn't Disneyland.On his way to find the Taureg, Prorok stops by the temple of Jupiter Ammon, \"where Alexander the Great became a god,\" and then visits the Troglodytes of the Matmatas, who were living Neanderthals. Somewhere south of the Mountain of Snakes, Prorok finds the Tauregs. They are every bit the tall, silent warriors and bandits he expected them to be. There are about 5,000 of them, living in a feudal system, still carrying the swords of the crusaders, with jewelry and coins from the 17th century. Everywhere Prorok sees links between the Tauregs and medieval Europe -- and Atlantis. He also describes the Tauregs as a near super-race. He saw men run straight at a bar six feet off the ground and clear it with a single jump. His photographer shot 40,000 feet of motion picture film.But Prorok and his companions never relaxed:\"There is no question but what one feels the malignity that envelops the hidden personality of the Taureg, and at times it is surprisingly easy to recall the death-dealing spear that traversed Reygasse's tent one silent night, or the tombs of Palat and Douls and Flatters, far out in the sands, or what is far more tragic because of its nearness to me, the passing of some of my own brave comrades, killed by Taureg as I write these lines.\"In December, 1928, after Prorok's sojourn with the Tauregs, his friends, General Clavery and Captains Debenne, Pasquet, and Resset were massacred on the road to Beni Abbes. A few months later 83 French officers and men were killed by the Tauregs at Ain Yacoub.One reason Prorok lingered with the Tauregs was that he wanted to find the tomb of their queen, Tin Hinan, which would contain clues to the Taureg's mysterious origin. On October 18, 1927, he found the tomb. He had to excavate in a hurry, however, before the Tauregs realized whose tomb it was. With only a few companions, out of food and almost out of water, he dug. Near the top of the tomb they found Roman coins from the time of Emperor Constantine and other relics from the faraway Mediterranean. Then they found the queen herself, draped with precious jewels.Just as the Tauregs were about to descend and wipe out the party, reinforcements arrived with food and weapons, and de Prorok escaped with his treasures. Some of this material is also covered in the author's In Quest of Lost Worlds (1935), but Prorok goes into far better (and different) detail here. Mysterious Sahara is a book you will probably read more than once. Check out Prorok's other books as well: Digging for Lost African Gods (1926), and Dead Men Do Tell Tales (1942). All are available from The Narrative Press.",

                "comment":"<p>Note: I haven\u2019t actually played this adventure. I was just reading it to get a \u201cfeel\u201d of Eberron. And I don\u2019t usually read adventure modules.<br \/><br \/>So for starters, this adventure is a continuation of sorts of a very basic introductory adventure that was included as part of the <i>Eberron Campaign Setting<\/i>. The same quest giver is giving them a follow-up mission.<br \/><br \/>I\u2019m not expert but it felt like this adventure asked a lot of the adventurers for just being a second mission. I suppose the authors wanted to \u201cshowcase\u201d more of Eberron and thrust into settings that are unique to Eberron - namely, a goblinoid city as well as the Mournland. But there\u2019s really no drive and motivation for the PCs to do that, since their House Cannith employer was just a one-time employer, and the purpose of the mission was somewhat mundane (i.e. go very far away from your home city, find a secret location in a supposedly very dangerous land, and pick something up).<br \/><br \/>But it\u2019s all right I suppose, if the PCs are game for it. The next bit that\u2019s a bit odd is that there are actually 4 rival factions here (two of House Cannith - why? neither adventure explains it), but none of them play any big part really, aside from one minor skirmish with evil faction no. 1, sneaking around a bunch of very oblivious evil faction no. 2, and finally getting ambushed by evil faction no. 2 as a way to set up a recurring villain. A major part of the exploration involves none of them, so I think it was a poor use of opposing factions.<br \/><br \/>Anyway, I think this adventure can be summed up as \u201cadequate\u201d. It\u2019s playable, for sure, but I think it doesn\u2019t quite showcase Eberron as much as it obviously wanted to. Yes, it does present the more advanced \u201ctechnological\u201d developments of the setting, but it\u2019s a miss when it comes to trying to capture roleplaying aspects that are supposed to be different from other settings.<\/p>",
