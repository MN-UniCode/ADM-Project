Zibaldone, his 4,500-page intellectual diary-a vast collection of thoughts on philosophy, civilization, literary criticism, linguistics, humankind and its vanities, and other varied topics-remained unpublished until more than a half-century after his death. But shortly before he died, Leopardi began to organize a small, thematic collection of his writings in an attempt to give structure and system to his philosophical musings. Now freshly translated into English by master translator, novelist, and critic Tim Parks, Leopardi's Passions presents 164 entries reflecting the full breadth of human passion. The volume offers a fascinating introduction to Leopardi's arguments and insights, as well as a glimpse of the concerns of thinkers to come, among them Nietzsche, Dostoyevsky, Wittgenstein, Gadda, and Beckett\"--",

        "description":"A masterly crafted and haunting tale of survival, longing, and empathy, set during the Spanish Civil War. In late 1936, eighteen-year-old Isidro Elejalde leaves his Basque village in Northern Spain, spurred to join the fight to preserve his country's democracy from the insurrectionists by the rousing words of a political essayist. Months earlier, Spanish generals launched a military coup to overthrow Spain's newly elected left-wing government. They assumed the population would welcome the coup, but throughout the country people like Isidro remained loyal to the ideals of democracy, and the Spanish Civil War began in bloody earnest. In Bilbao, Mariana raises her two young children while, with her writing, she decries the fascist-backed coup and their German and Italian allies, imploring the world to support democracy. As the Nationalist forces assault the country, Mariana and Isidro's lives intersect fleetingly, yet in meaningful and lasting ways. Through a chorus of voices--a female soldier in an all-male battalion, a reluctant conscript recently emigrated from Cuba, a young girl whose parents have abandoned her in order to fight against the fascists, among others--we follow Isidro and Mariana as they struggle to maintain their humanity in a country determined to tear itself apart. Julian Zabalbeascoa is a fierce and assured new talent, and What We Tried to Bury Grows Here is a remarkable feat of research and imagination, as well as a transcendent literary accomplishment.",

        "description":"On a warm March night in 2083, Judy Wallach-Stevens wakes to a warning of unknown pollutants in the Chesapeake Bay. She heads out to check what she expects to be a false alarm--and stumbles upon the first alien visitors to Earth. These aliens have crossed the galaxy to save humanity, convinced that the people of Earth must leave their ecologically-ravaged planet behind and join them among the stars. And if humanity doesn't agree, they may need to be saved by force.The watershed networks aren't ready to give up on Earth. Decades ago, they rose up to exile the last corporations to a few artificial islands, escape the dominance of nation-states, and reorganize humanity around the hope of keeping their world liveable. By sharing the burden of decision-making, they've started to heal the wounded planet. But now corporations, nation-states, and networks all vie to represent humanity to these powerful new beings, and if any one accepts the aliens' offer, Earth may be lost. With everyone's eyes turned skyward, everything hinges on the success of Judy's effort to create understanding, both within and beyond her own species.A literary descendent of Ursula K. Le Guin, Emrys crafts a novel of extraterrestrial diplomacy and urgent climate repair bursting with quiet, tenuous hope and an underlying warmth. A Half-Built Garden depicts a world worth building towards, a humanity worth saving from itself, and an alien community worth entering with open arms. It's not the easiest future to build, but it's one that just might be in reach.",

                "comment":"<p>It\u2019s probably more of a high 3.5.<br \/><br \/>This is another of those arcs of mine which got put on the back burner because I couldn\u2019t focus and could only manage to get to it now coz I got my hands on the audiobook, which was very helpful and I finished listening the whole thing in less than 4 days. But now trying to review it isn\u2019t an easy task. <br \/><br \/>I\u2019m unsure how to categorize this one in ways I understand. It has many characters who have varying motivations and values and methods of dealing with issues, but we also only get one POV which doesn\u2019t lend itself to too much character development. There is exploring of relationships - motherhood and in general, child rearing playing a very important part of this book - and we see how new bonds are made between people of various species with  varied interests, and how this affects the overall fate of the people and the planet\/habitat. <br \/><br \/>But it\u2019s also not a completely plot focused novel. It\u2019s a very simple plot point if we think about it - aliens are here who think earth will not survive and want to take all of humanity onto their space habitats (maybe by force) and it\u2019s the turn of various communities on earth who have been working tirelessly to reverse the effects of climate change, to convince them otherwise. How this happens is the plot. But the way the author goes about it involves contemplation, arguments, discussions, consensus building and not any big action set pieces that we would expect from these kind of futuristic novels. <br \/><br \/>Ultimately what remains in our memory after finishing the book is all the concepts that are explored here. There are watershed communities that have been formed around large sustaining rivers who have worked incessantly to bring more ecological balance and reverse the drastic effects of climate change. The technology they use combined with their negotiation methods and how they build consensus to solve methods feels like something to aspire to if we ever want to actually solve problems which are plaguing our world today. We also see corporations and how they\u2019ve created their own world within the world, but I don\u2019t think we got a clearly sense of how their hierarchy and structure works. Their way of treating everything like a game wasn\u2019t something I understood entirely, but I did understand the resentments some of the people living in those lands had against the watersheds. The watersheds ofcourse have their own grievances with the corporations which destroyed the world for their greed. But the author also does an interesting job of giving us mostly clear cut notions of who is ultimately responsible for how close the earth came to collapse, but also the fact that playing a blame game decades later doesn\u2019t help anyone and it\u2019s more necessary to work together. <br \/><br \/>This idea of consensus building is greatly put to the test when our main protagonist and her family have to argue their case in front of the aliens for wanting to stay on earth, confident that the work they\u2019ve put into is helping restore balance to the planet and more can be done with the help of the Ringer\u2019s high tech. The author illustrates the importance of trying to understand each other view points, the necessity of negotiating with even those people who\u2019ve tried to harm you, and how understanding each other\u2019s motivations and goals and helping each other in bettering everyone is the only way to resolve conflict without violence. <br \/><br \/>Ultimately, I felt it was an admirable attempt at creating a hopeful story of building families and communities which will all work together to avert disasters. Its nicely aided by an eccentric cast of characters - both humans and aliens and their respective delightful children - and lots of intense negotiations and conversations. But while I hope that humanity is capable of being this community oriented, the cynic in me thinks it\u2019s unrealistically hopeful and that optimism of it all just made me sad, coz it felt impossible. However, I\u2019m very eager to see what more interesting concepts the author comes up with next in her books.<\/p>",

Occasionally I\u2019ll pick something up that has elements that sound appealing to me, but I don\u2019t seek out sci fi on purpose. I picked up A Half Built Garden because the theme of attempting to bring Earth back from the human caused brink of destruction appealed to me, but somehow the description I read failed to mention that there were aliens in this book. I might have steered clear if I had known, but then I would have missed a delightful surprise of a book. Judy Wallach-Stevens is an ecologist with the Chesapeake watershed, in a world which has reorganized itself into networks of watersheds, communities that monitor and tend their local bodies of water and their ecosystems. Decisions are made by technologically assisted consensus, where people share their knowledge to be able to come to decisions that treat humans as part of the ecosystem, but not more important than the ecosystem. The story begins when Judy is making her customary rounds one night and receives an alert that there is a disturbance. When she investigates, she finds an alien ship has landed\u2026and the story takes off from there. <br \/><br \/>A Half-Built Garden has a fully imagined world, where family structure, gender, uses of technology, politics, diplomacy, and ethos with regard to the natural world are addressed. However, you learn about all of these things work as you watch Judy Wallach-Stevens deal with the repercussions of finding an alien spaceship in her watershed, rather than by being told about them explicitly. Ruthanna Emrys immerses her readers in her world skillfully, so that you enjoy the sensation of finding out about child rearing practices in this new world rather than feeling like you\u2019re groping around in an unfamiliar place.<br \/><br \/>Without giving anything more away about the plot, I will also say that this novel also deals with issues of consent, and of people coming in as rescuers when the supposed rescuees don\u2019t think they need to and don\u2019t want to be rescued. I <em>really<\/em> liked the way Emrys handled this topic.<br \/><br \/>Summary: I wouldn\u2019t have picked this book if I had really known what it was, but I was surprised all the way through by how much I liked it.<\/p>",

By charting the institutional obstacles and cultural pressures that continue to leave even the most advantaged women facing impossible options, \"Opting Out?\" gets beneath the hype and offers the real story behind the misleading headlines.",

                "comment":"<p>Satisfying and reflective novel putting the inner thoughts of a father and husband dealing with his wife\u2019s comatose state and impending death, while trying to help his two daughters accept and battle with grief and loss. Secrets revealed about the less-than-perfect relationships bring more guilt and shame to the situation, but most of the issues are transformed into growth and acceptance. <br \/><br \/>I liked the way the author used dialogue to create authentic characters and situations. The father, Matt King, became very real to me simply through reading the thoughts he had about his wife, being a parent, dealing with his extended family, etc. I found myself smiling when Scottie, the youngest daughter, would make her awkward remarks and show herself to have so much more going on inside than what she shows to the outside world. All this done simply through Matt\u2019s thoughts and conversations with her. <br \/><br \/>I\u2019d recommend this book to people interested in a beach read, but without lame romance plots or predictable thriller plots. I can see why the book was made into a movie because the setting and pacing of the book seems made for that format. I haven\u2019t seen the movie yet, but I want to now because I enjoyed the book.<\/p>",

Gazing out at the shadowy woods, Sandy has no idea that tonight her life will be forever changed. As a late autumn sky darkens over the Adirondack mountains, and the threat of a heavy snowfall looms, the mood in the Tremont house is already charged with tension. Upstairs in her bedroom, teenage Ivy listens to music and broods, while below in the kitchen, Sandy sips coffee and tries not to take her daughter's latest snit personally. But when her husband Ben, a wilderness guide, arrives home, the troubled atmosphere immediately lightens--and Sandy can push all the discord to the back of her mind. Nearby, two desperate men on the run make their way through the fading light, bloodstained and determined to leave no loose ends or witnesses. After nearly two decades as prison cellmates, they have become a deadly team: Harlan the muscle, Nick the mind and will. As they approach a secluded house, its spacious windows revealing a cozy scene within, Nick instinctually knows that here he will find what he's looking for--before disappearing north. When he opens the door to the Tremont home, Nick brings with him a long legacy of terror. Armed with only the truth, Sandy must fight to protect the family she loves, even as a terrible secret threatens to drag her into the darkness.

During the period of Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson, the United States and the Soviet Union acted out the world's tensions on three important island nations, Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Meanwhile, the leaders of these nations--the charismatic Fidel Castro and his mysterious brother Ra\u00fal; the ideologue Che Guevara; the capricious psychopath Rafael Trujillo; and Fran\u00e7ois \"Papa Doc\" Duvalier, a buttoned-down doctor with interests in Vodou, embezzlement and torture--had ambitions of their own. The superpowers thought they could use Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic as puppets, but what neither bargained on was that their puppets would come to life. Historian Alex von Tunzelmann's narrative follows these five rivals and accomplices from the beginning of the Cold War to its end.--From publisher description.",

        "description":"The revolutionary work of graphic storytelling that inspired a new art form. Will Eisner was present at the dawn of comics. In the 1940s, he pushed the boundaries of the medium with his acclaimed weekly comic strip The Spirit, and with the publication of A Contract with God in 1978, he created a new medium altogether: the graphic novel. It was unlike anything seen before, heralding an era when serious cartoonists were liberated from the limiting confines of the comic strip. Eisner\u2019s work was a shining example of what comics could be: as inventive, moving, and complex as any literary art form. Eisner considered himself \u201ca graphic witness reporting on life, death, heartbreak, and the never-ending struggle to prevail.\u201d A Contract with God begins with a gripping tale that mirrors the artist\u2019s real-life tragedy, the death of his daughter. Frimme Hersh, a devout Jew, questions his relationship with God after the loss of his own beloved child. Hersh\u2019s crisis is intertwined with the lives of the other unforgettable denizens of Eisner\u2019s iconic Dropsie Avenue, a fictionalized version of the quintessential New York City street where he came of age at the height of the Depression. This centennial edition showcases Eisner\u2019s singular visual style in new high-resolution scans of his original art, complete with an introduction by Scott McCloud and an illuminating history of Eisner\u2019s seminal work. Now readers can experience the legendary book that launched a unique art form and reaffirmed Will Eisner as one of the great pioneers of American graphic storytelling.",

                "comment":"<p>Will Eisner is an interesting figure for me.  He\u2019s one of those names that always turns up whenever people talk about the most influential and important storytellers in the medium of graphic fiction, but at the same time, he\u2019s someone who I\u2019ve never been able to understand the hype about, having read only his Spirit work.<br \/><br \/>Now I get it.  This book was a complete revelation for me - the way Eisner uses the simplest of pen strokes to create emotive environments, the way he can craft scenes that are both sparse and rich at the same time.  The way he can tell four stories that are completely different from each other, but which are really all the same story.  Beautiful and brilliant.<\/p>",

        "description":"\"With The Steel Remains, award-winning science fiction writer Richard K. Morgan turned his talents to sword and sorcery. The result: a genre-busting masterwork hailed as a milestone in contemporary epic fantasy. Now Morgan continues the riveting saga of Ringil Eskiath--Gil, for short--a peerless warrior whose love for other men has made him an outcast and pariah.  Only a select few have earned the right to call Gil friend. One is Egar, the Dragonbane, a fierce Majak fighter who comes to respect a heart as savage and loyal as his own. Another is Archeth, the last remaining daughter of an otherworldly race called the Kiriath, who once used their advanced technology to save the world from the dark magic of the Aldrain--only to depart for reasons as mysterious as their arrival. Yet even Egar and Archeth have learned to fear the doom that clings to their friend like a grim shadow. or the curse of a bitter god.  Now one of the Kiriath's uncanny machine intelligences has fallen from orbit--with a message that humanity faces a grave new danger (or, rather, an ancient one): a creature called the Illwrack Changeling, a boy raised to manhood in the ghostly between-world realm of the Grey Places, home to the Aldrain. A human raised as one of them--and, some say, the lover of one of their greatest warriors--until, in a time lost to legend, he was vanquished. Wrapped in sorcerous slumber, hidden away on an island that drifts between this world and the Grey Places, the Illwrack Changeling is stirring. And when he wakes, the Aldrain will rally to him and return in force--this time without the Kiriath to stop them.  An expedition is outfitted for the long and arduous sea journey to find the lost island of the Illwrack Changeling. Aboard are Gil, Egar, and Archeth: each fleeing from ghosts of the past, each seeking redemption in whatever lies ahead. But redemption doesn't come cheap these days. Nor, for that matter, does survival. Not even for Ringil Eskiath. Or anyone--god or mortal--who would seek to use him as a pawn\"--",

Erno Rubik inspires us with what he\u2019s learned in a lifetime of creating, curiosity, and discovery. Erno Rubik was a child when he first became obsessed with puzzles of all kinds. \u201cPuzzles,\u201d he writes, \u201cbring out important qualities in each of us: concentration, curiosity, a sense of play, the eagerness to discover a solution.\u201d To Rubik puzzles aren\u2019t just games\u2014they\u2019re creativity machines. He encourages us to embrace our inner curiosity and find the puzzles that surround us in our everyday lives. \u201cIf you are determined, you will solve them,\u201d he writes. Rubik\u2019s own puzzle, the Cube, went on to be solved by millions worldwide for over forty years, become one of the bestselling toys of all time, and to be featured as a global symbol of intelligence and ingenuity. In Cubed, Rubik covers more than just his journey to inventing his eponymous cube. He makes a case for always being an amateur\u2014something he has always considered himself to be. He discusses the inevitability of problems during any act of invention. He reveals what it was like to experience the astonishing worldwide success of an object he made purely for his own play. And he offers what he thinks it means to be a true creator (hint: anyone can do it). Steeped in the wisdom and also the humility of a born inventor, Cubed offers a unique look at the imperfect science of creation.",

        "description":"\"America has long been criticized for refusing to give harbor to the Jews of Europe as Hitler and the Nazis closed in. Now a U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum scholar tells the extraordinary story of the War Refugee Board, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's little-known effort late in the war to save the Jews who remained. In January 1944, a young Treasury lawyer named John Pehle accompanied his boss to a meeting with the president. For more than a decade, the Jews of Germany had sought refuge in the United States and had been stymied by Congress's harsh immigration policy. Now the State Department was refusing to authorize relief funds Pehle wanted to use to help Jews escape Nazi territory. At the meeting, Pehle made his best case--and prevailed. Within days, FDR created the War Refugee Board, empowering it to rescue the victims of Nazi persecution, and put John Pehle in charge. Over the next twenty months, Pehle pulled together a team of D.C. pencil pushers, international relief workers, pirates, diplomats, millionaires, confidence men, and rabble-rousers to run operations across four continents and a dozen countries. Together, they tricked the Nazis, forged identity papers, smuggled food into concentration camps, recruited spies, leaked news stories, negotiated ransoms, and funneled millions of dollars into Europe. They bought weapons for the French Resistance and ships to transport Romanian refugees to Palestine. Altogether, they saved tens of thousands of lives. In Rescue Board, U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum scholar Rebecca Erbelding uses unrivaled access to archival materials and fresh interviews with survivors to tell the dramatic unknown story of America's last-ditch effort to save the Jews of Europe\"--",

        "description":"As a college student he spent 16 days in the Pacific Ocean with five guys and a crate of canned meat. As a father he took his kids on a world tour to eat ice cream with heads of state. He made friends in Uganda, and they liked him so much he became the Ugandan consul. He pursued his wife for three years before she agreed to date him. His grades weren't good enough to get into law school, so he sat on a bench outside the Dean's office for seven days until they finally let him enroll. Bob Goff has become something of a legend, and his friends consider him the world's best-kept secret. Those same friends have long insisted he write a book. What follows are paradigm shifts, musings, and stories from one of the world's most delightfully engaging and winsome people. What fuels his impact? Love. But it's not the kind of love that stops at thoughts and feelings. Bob's love takes action. Bob believes Love Does. When Love Does, life gets interesting. Each day turns into a hilarious, whimsical, meaningful chance that makes faith simple and real. Each chapter is a story that forms a book, a life. And this is one life you don't want to miss. Light and fun, unique and profound, the lessons drawn from Bob's life and attitude just might inspire you to be secretly incredible, too. - Publisher.",

Bob Goff has lived an incredible life, but what I had to keep reminding myself throughout the book is that the source and inspiration for his incredible life is not himself but his relationship with Jesus and His love that Bob desires to live out. Every time I want to gawk at Bob Goff, I have to remember that I can live like that, too. This book is an easy read, but I recommend reading it slowly, digesting each chapter and pondering the implications for life. The stories are often fun, sometimes poignant and occasionally stop-in-your-tracks powerful. I can\u2019t recommend this book enough.<\/p>",

I really enjoyed the anecdotes and call to actively love people - in small and big ways. However, I see this book as more of a memoir than a how-to or piece of theological writing and feel that is important to distinguish. The book lacks depth into what the gospel truly is and he only vaguely references scripture throughout, often providing his thoughts or interpretations without scripture backing these ideas. Nonetheless, I still have great respect for Goff and how he has used his privilege and affluence to serve others locally and globally.<\/p>",

        "description":"This book is the beginning of a long road. It exists within a paradox of detailed research and the fierce resistance of dogma. This book is for the iconoclast. The magus who rejects blind adherence and who struggles against the invisible prison of tradition. For rouge scholars, artists, hackers, Goths, or any other magus on the underground path of evolution. \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law\", with attitude. Post-Modern A school of thought primarily concerned with the deconstruction of meta-narratives. In this text it is the rejection of the idea that there is only one way of magick. Magick The use of Will to elicit change in Reality. Post-Modern Magick is self-initiation and exploration based on personal relevance and free form magick. These pages contain not only a manuscript on post-modern magick in theory and practice, but also new post-modern grimoires such as Reality Hacker, all in print for the first time alongside more traditional text.",

        "description":"In America's battle against al-Qaeda and their allies, the goal of the Navy SEALs is to be the best guns in the fight--stealthy, effective, professional, and lethal. Here for the first time is a SEAL insider's battle history of these Special Operations warriors in the war on terrorism. \"Down range\" is what SEALs in Afghanistan and Iraq call their area of operations. In this new mode of warfare, \"down range\" can refer to anything from tracking roving bands of al-Qaeda on a remote mountain trail in Afghanistan to taking down an armed compound in Tikrit and rousting holdouts from Saddam Hussein's regime. It could mean interdicting insurgents smuggling car-bomb explosives over the Iraqi-Syrian border or silently boarding a freighter on the high seas at night to enforce an embargo. In other words, \"down range\" could be anywhere, anytime, under any conditions. In Down Range, author Dick Couch, himself a former Navy SEAL and CIA case officer, uses his unprecedented access to bring the reader firsthand accounts from the warriors in combat during key missions in Afghanistan and Iraq. Couch creates a pulse-pounding, detailed narrative of the definitive engagements of this war, while painting an unusually intimate portrait of these warriors in the field. The performance of the SEALs in difficult, changing environments--in the heat of the Afghan desert, in the snow-packed Hindu Kush, on the high seas, and in the urban chaos of Baghdad--has been nothing short of extraordinary. The SEALs, coordinating with other American forces, the CIA, and foreign special operations units like the Polish GROM, have once more shown their genius for improvisation and capacity for courageous action in leading the fight against this new and vicious enemy. The first battle history of its kind, Down Range is a riveting close-up of some of America's finest warriors in action against a deadly foe.   Also available as an eBookFrom the Hardcover edition.",

Friedman last year (In Conquest Born, The Wilding, The Madness Season and This Alien Shore) I???ve been practically desperate to begin her more famous COLDFIRE SAGA. Friedman???s stories are smart and creative and I can???t wait to see what else she has to offer. The only thing that???s so far kept me from picking up Black Sun Rising, the first COLDFIRE novel, is that I already have a huge stack (I mean hundreds) of audiobooks purchased and ready to read at Audible and on my bookshelves at home. Mostly I collect these when they???re on sale or when publishers send me review copies, so I hoard my precious Audible credits and spend them like a miser.<br \/><br \/>But I just don???t know how much longer I can hold out on COLDFIRE.

That feeling didn\u2019t last long, however. I couldn\u2019t put the book down; it slowly drew you in until I couldn\u2019t stop reading.<br \/><br \/>You get drips of information that slowly help you put together the puzzle of the town. I was honestly surprised at some of the turns, and even the things I suspected managed to take me off guard somehow.<br \/><br \/>The atmosphere and characters are what make this book compelling. The small town with a dark past hanging over it, the feeling of danger right around the corner. And all the characters are captivating \u2013 and suspicious.<br \/><br \/>I loved both of the narrators in the book. Odette, a young cop with ties to the town tragedy, and Angel, the young girl Odette is trying to help. I loved both perspectives, and how their connection, though short, had such a lasting impact. <br \/><br \/>Odette lost one of her legs the night Trumanell disappeared, ten years before the book takes place. Her experiences in the book were eye-opening. Her reality is something I know nothing about, and some of her struggles I would never have considered. The same with Angel and her missing eye. <br \/><br \/>This book creeps up on you. The characters get under your skin, and you can\u2019t stop reading because you need to know everyone is okay. <i> We Are All the Same in the Dark<\/i> will unquestionably be a hit with my patrons.<br \/><br \/><i>Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for providing this ARC in exchange for an honest review.<\/i><br \/><\/p>",

This keeps the story fresh and sets it apart from some the usual police-hunt-badguys thriller staples out there. <br \/><br \/>Heaberlin builds up two solid, well built main characters who we can sympathise with and understand their motivations. Some of the supplementary characters are a little more obtuse but that\u2019s necessity of the mystery genre.<br \/><br \/>Overall it\u2019s a well-structured, -paced and -finished novel that delivers a good storyline with believable characters.<\/p>",

Am I turning into a thriller reader??<br \/><br \/>Both Odette and Angel were fascinating protagonists, and I was glad to spend time with them. Also I shouldn\u2019t be surprised \u2018cuz it\u2019s not like it\u2019s hard to become a biological parent, but still I\u2019m always surprised when characters have really shitty parents. Like, not beating your kids or putting a hit out on them actually is pretty easy. Oooh and there were some good religious overtones about forgiveness and guilt that were interesting though not theologically sound. Also some good disability rep, and the author had an interesting note about her research in the back, which I appreciated.<br \/><br \/>4.5 but I\u2019m feeling generous :)<\/p>",

Dort findet er sich in einem smarten Apartment wieder: Geld und Astronautennahrung werden von einer Drohne geliefert, die Temperatur automatisch reguliert, der K\u00fchlschrank ist sein einziger Gespr\u00e4chspartner. Das Computerspiel \"Cloud Control\" bietet die einzige Abwechslung, es speist sich in Echtzeit aus den Daten der Gamer. Bei einem NBA-Spiel trifft Joshua die Meeresbiologin Claire, und die beiden reisen nach wenigen Wochen nach Nassau, wo Claire ihm er\u00f6ffnet, dass sie schwanger ist, jedoch offenl\u00e4sst, ob das Kind von ihm ist. Flexen in Miami ist eine Liebesgeschichte, die auf vielfachen Ebenen danach fragt, woher wir wissen k\u00f6nnen, dass wir da sind, und wie wir einander begegnen k\u00f6nnen: als Menschen oder Avatare, im Leben genauso wie in der Cloud. In seinem lang erwarteten Roman erz\u00e4hlt Joshua Gro\u00df von den diversen Einkerbungen, Traps, Glitches und Unsicherheiten in der Realit\u00e4t, die wir unsere Gegenwart nennen.",

And though she sometimes still hears her father\u2019s whispers in her mind, she\u2019s excelling at school, making new friends, and has even attracted an enigmatic admirer. But when her new love interest begins to reveal his more unsavory appetites, Malory finds herself a hapless participant in sick games that force her to confront her nasty inner demons. As the game intensifies, so do the whispers in Malory\u2019s head. Now she must decide: accept the fate she\u2019s always believed inevitable, or risk losing the only person who ever made her feel like she was worth fighting for. But how do you let love in when the only thing that feels right is pain? At times erotic, at times disturbing, and at times both at once, Red Water slithers under your skin with its dark, unflinching examination of the psychology of self-loathing and the secret, unspeakable lust for depravity that lies dormant within us all. If you loved Caroline Kepnes\u2019s You or Gillian Flynn\u2019s Sharp Objects, you will love Red Water.",

In seventeenth century Venice exists a mysterious establishment known only as the Gameshouse. There, fortunes are made and fortunes are broken over games of chess, backgammon and every other game under the sun. But those whom fortune favours may be invited to compete in the higher league . . . a league where the games played are of politics and empires, of economics and kings. It is a league where Capture the Castle involves real castles, where hide and seek takes place on a scale as big as the British Isles. Not everyone proves worthy of competing in the higher league. But one woman who is about to play may just exceed everyone's expectations. Though she must always remember: the higher the stakes, the more deadly the rules . . . The three installments of the Gameshouse are also available in a single edition.",

In this extraordinary book, despite longstanding tabloid-style sexual preoccupations with monsters and victims, shame and virtue, JoAnn Wypijewski does exactly that. From the HIV crisis to the paedophile priest panic, Woody Allen to Brett Kavanaugh, child pornography to Abu Ghraib, Wypijewski takes the most famous sex panics of the last decades and turns them inside out, weaving what together becomes a searing indictment of modern sexual politics, exposing the myriad ways sex panics and the expansion of the punitive state are intertwined. What emerges is an examination of the multiple ways in which the ever-expanding default language of monsters and victims has contributed to the repressive power of the state. Politics exists in the mess of life. Sex does too, Wypijewski insists, and so must sexual politics, to make any sense at all.",

        "description":"Despite checking off the boxes of worldly accomplishments, most high-achieving women are secretly dissatisfied. They feel stuck in lives that look perfect on the outside, yet on the inside, they're unfulfilled, plagued by the nagging feeling that there's got to be more. They feel guilty and ungrateful for feeling trapped in lives that are so good. They disown their pain, or numb it with excessive work, eating, drinking, shopping, social media, or exercising. They search for solutions in books, meditation, yoga, therapy, medication, and workshops, but something is still missing. They wonder: What's wrong with me? Dr. Valerie Rein has worked with hundreds of high-achieving women and discovered that the issues they all struggle with are not just personal--they're rooted in the ancestral and collective trauma experienced by women in the patriarchal world for millennia. In Patriarchy Stress Disorder, Dr. Rein describes how this trauma creates an invisible inner prison, that holds them back from stepping into the full power of their authentic presence, unbridled joy, outrageous success, freedom, and fulfillment. In this book, Dr. Valerie explains: - Why you're dissatisfied in spite of your achievements, and why it's not your fault. - What secretly drains 90 percent of your time and energy, and how to reclaim it. - How to upgrade your game of \"How much can I bear?\" to \"How good can it get?\"",

Go inside a disparate group of media and tech companies -- Disney, Apple, AT&T\/WarnerMedia, Comcast\/NBCUniversal and well-funded startup Quibi \u2013 as they scramble to mount multi-billion-dollar challenges to Netflix. After spotting Netflix and the deep-pocketed Amazon Prime Video a decade\u2019s head start, rivals from the tech and start-up realm (Apple, Quibi) and traditional media (Disney, WarnerMedia, NBCUniversal) all decided to move mountains to enter the streaming game. At a cost of billions, each went after their own piece of the market, launching five new services in a seven-month span. And just as the derby was heating up, the coronavirus pandemic arrived, a black-swan event bringing short-term benefits but also stiff challenges. The battle for streaming supremacy may end up having more than one winner, but the cost and disruption to decades-old business models have also produced a lot of losers. Binge Times reveals the true costs of the vision quest as companies are turned inside-out and repeatedly redraw their org charts and strategic plans. Stretching from Silicon Valley to Hollywood to Wall Street, it is a mesmerizing, character-rich tale of hubris and ambition, as the fate of a century-old industry hangs in the balance.",

        "description":"Magick is cheap and power is all around you. The most vibrant magick in the world is that of survival. If you know how it works you can use it anywhere, with anything, to do whatever you need or desire. Tactics is defined as the choice and application of technique in a specific situation. The purpose of tactical magick is to take the magick of survival and incorporate it into our daily lives. So called High Magick is chiefly concerned with expanding consciousness, contacting higher planes, and achieving gnosis. Tactical magick is about learning from the plight of those less fortunate and building upon their techniques to create an eclectic grimoire of daily survival. This is a patchwork system of pop-culture sorcery, techno-alchemy, and hermetic street magick.",

The composition is fairly good though, and I like the typography. <br \/><br \/>I think this may be my favorite LUCY WILD book to date. It was just SO deliciously British. As always it was also well written and nicely paced. Had an interesting plot. Had likable and (reasonably) well developed characters. I would probably say this was middle of the road in the intensity of the Daddy kink. I was also happy to see we got more smokin\u2019 hot sex scenes in this one since the last two books have been relatively mild (for me) in that department. <br \/><br \/> <br \/><br \/>It was <i>ALMOST<\/i> a perfect read. I think the overall the plot and the characters could have been a bit more fleshed out. Certain things plotwise were resolved a little too easily. I would have also liked to have seen a bit more relationship buildup between Donna and George. Lastly, not a fan of the ending. We are kind of just left hanging with a tease. If any book demanded a better epilogue (the one included is only two months in the future), it was this one (see my added note).<br \/><br \/>In any case, even with those small issues, I adored this one. Two thumbs up from yours truly.<br \/><br \/><b>ADDED NOTE:<\/b> Straight from the author\u2019s mouth\u2026\u201cAs with the last book, there will be a bonus epilogue set six months later for newsletter sign ups.\u201d<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>",

        "publicationYear":2010,
        "description":"Although criticized at one time for its highly tendentious spirit, Dostoevsky's Demons (1871-1872) has proven to be a novel of great polemical vitality. Originally inspired by a minor conspiratorial episode of the late 1860s, well after Dostoevsky's death (1881) the work continued to earn both acclaim and contempt for its scathing caricature of revolutionists driven by destructive, anarchic aims. The text of Demons assumed new meaning in Russian literary culture following the Bolshevik triumph of 1917, when the reestablishment and expansion of centralized state power inevitably revived interest in the radical populist tendencies of Russia's past, in particular the anarchist thought of Dostoevsky's legendary contemporary, Mikhail Bakunin (1814-1876). Confronting Dostoevsky's 'Demons' is the first book to explore the life of Dostoevsky's novel in light of disputes and controversies over Bakunin's troubling legacy in Russia. Contrary to the traditional view, which assumes the obsolescence of Demons throughout much of the Communist period (1917-1991), this book demonstrates that the potential resurgence of Bakuninist thought actually encouraged reassessments of Dostoevsky's novel. By exploring the different ideas and critical strategies that motivated opposing interpretations of the novel in post-revolutionary Russia, Confronting Dostoevsky's 'Demons' reveals how the potential resurrection of Bakunin's anti-authoritarian ethos fostered the return of a politically reactionary novel to the canon of Russian classics.",

The Unlikely Peace at Cuchumaquic is both an epic story and a cry to the heart of humanity based on the author\u2019s realization that human survival depends on keeping alive the seeds of our \u201coriginal forgotten spiritual excellence.\u201d Prechtel relates our current state of ecological crisis to the rapid disappearance of biodiversity, indigenous cultures, and shared human values. He demonstrates how real human culture is exterminated when real (not genetically modified) seeds are lost. Like plants that become extinct once their required conditions are no longer met, authentic, unmonetized human cultures can no longer survive in the modern world. To \u201ckeep the seeds alive\u201d\u2014both literally and metaphorically\u2014they must be planted, harvested, and replanted, just as human culture must become truly engaging and meaningful to the soul, as necessary as food is to the body.

        "description":"The voices of those who witnessed the Battle of Gettysburg and its aftermath with their own eyes - who saw the bloodshed, heard its din, trembled in its crash, struggled with its aftermath - are collected for the first time by Allen C. Guelzo, America's foremost Civil War scholar, in this moving and sobering oral history. This treasure trove of original documents - many never-before published - creates a uniquely personal, day-by-day eyewitness account of the monumental collision at Gettysburg, in the words of the commanders, soldiers, politicians, and civilians from both the North and the South who experienced firsthand the changing course of the Civil War. Three pivotal days in 1963 - July 1st through July 3rd - marked the beginning of the end of the Civil War. While the audible voices of those who experienced it first-hand in that crossroads town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania have been lost to history, their words live on in Voices from Gettysburg. Gathering a treasure trove of powerful, rare, and haunting original documents, New York Times bestselling author and award-winning historian Allen C. Guelzo presents a uniquely readable and intimate oral history of the Civil War's turning point. We hear from a Union staff officer, a Confederate amputee, artilleryman, a sympathetic Northern woman, a Union prisoner-of-war, Union colonels and Confederate generals, a drummer boy, a fearful college student, those who orchestrated the Battle of Gettysburg, those who survived it, and those who would perish. With introductions from Guelzo, a detailed order of battle, and comprehensive list of every unit that fought, each of these original maps, personal letters, excerpts from forgotten memoirs, and more never-before-published documents offers an unprecedented narrative of the Great Rebellion and the impetus for Lincoln's Gettysburg Address - in the authentic words of fire, blood, and smoke by those who saw the battle, heard its din, trembled in its crash, and struggled with its aftermath.",

Great compostition and great title work. <br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>Vague is the name of the game for this review. I don\u2019t want to give too much away because this is a book best gone into without any spoilers. I will say that it was fantastically well written and paced. It had twists and turns. It had well developed and interesting characters. It was full of multiple POVs that I usually would find jarring but worked well in this instance as they all added a unique perspective to the overall plot. My only complaint is that I thought the ending was a little anti-climatic.<br \/><br \/>Overall though this was a fantastic read and I cannot wait to read the sequel (?)

Spence organizes a world's worth of magic -- from \"Ab\" (a magical month in the ancient Semitic calendar) to \"Zulu witch-finders\" -- into 2,500 dictionary-style entries that explore concepts and personalities both familiar (Freemasonry, Morgan le Fay) and obscure: palingenesy (a process by which plants or vegetables are destroyed and then \"resurrected\"), Leonora Galigai (a 17th-century Italian aristocrat who was burned as a witch). A delight for devotees of the weird and the strange, and a valuable resource for students of mythology and the evolution of scientific thought, this important volume is at home in the libraries of all book lovers. Scottish journalist and folklorist LEWIS SPENCE (1874 -1955) was a Fellow of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, and Vice-President of the Scottish Anthropological and Folklore Society. He published more than 40 works on mythology and the occult, including History of Atlantis, An Introduction to Mythology, and Myth and Ritual in Dance, Game and Rhyme.",

She decided instead to acquire an education and to participate in the liberation of Egypt from the British occupation. Huda became famous overnight when she led a peaceful walk of veiled women across Cairo in 1919 to free the leaders of the Egyptian resistance who were detained by the British forces. She was then invited by the members of the Bureau of the IAWS (International Alliance for Women s Suffrage) to participate in the international conference in Rome in 1923. Huda became the lifelong friend of Western and other feminist leaders at that conference. It was after this conference in Cairo when she and her two traveling companions removed their face veil upon leaving the train at the railway station and were spontaneously imitated by all the other women in what became a landmark gesture in Egyptian history. In 1923, Huda founded the Egyptian Feminist Union affiliated to the IAWS, and began publishing a French magazine, L Egyptienne, to circulate information about Egypt s plight and achievements under the occupation, and to promote peace between Eastern and Western countries. She soon became - and remained for many years - one of the Vice-Presidents of the International Organization of Women.",

You crave them in a way that's not rational, not right, and you're becoming somebody you don't recognise, and certainly don't respect, but you don't even care. And this person you like is unattainable. Except for one thing . . . He lives downstairs. Abbie has three obsessions. Art. The ocean. And Kane.But since Kane's been back, he's changed. There's a darkness shadowing him that only Abbie can see. And it wants her in its world. A Gothic story about the very dark things that feed the creative process, from the winner of the 2010 Victorian Premier's Literary Award for young adult fiction. There are images in this novel that take my breath away, dialogue that I envy and one of the most achingly real protagonists I've come across for a long while.' Melina Marchetta",

When you open this ebook and you want to see the cross stitch pattern clearly you have two options print out the pattern (I don\u2019t recommend it as this will cost you more money! And it kills trees!) Or Simply click on your View tab at the top of your windows screen and enlarge the picture. I like to see the cross stitch pattern at 150% or larger as you can see each square easily. You will notice that the cross stitch pattern cannot be read easily when they are viewed at 100%. The reason for this is simple if the pattern was any larger the download time would take ages. The color graph gives you the DMC colors that you will need to complete the picture. The Projects should be completed on 14-count Aida material. Total number of stitches are 22500. Complete this project using 66 DMC colored cottons. This finished cross stitch pattern may be sold for any price you wish.",

This account reveals what is posited as inherent racism and sexism within the church and seeks to expose the controlling methods of indoctrination and the harsh process of excommunication. The basic tenets of the religion are explained, personal stories and analyses are shared, and church authorities are cited to support the claims of extreme gender and racial discrimination. From unknowing follower to angry rebel, and finally to a content, worldly man, this book recounts the experience of a survivor who feels the duty to explain his truth.",

        "description":"A New York Times Notable Book of the Year. Shortlisted for the 2016 Man Booker Prize, Hot Milk moves \"gracefully among pathos, danger, and humor\u201d (The New York Times). I have been sleuthing my mother's symptoms for as long as I can remember. If I see myself as an unwilling detective with a desire for justice, is her illness an unsolved crime? If so, who is the villain and who is the victim? Sofia, a young anthropologist, has spent much of her life trying to solve the mystery of her mother's unexplainable illness. She is frustrated with Rose and her constant complaints, but utterly relieved to be called to abandon her own disappointing fledgling adult life. She and her mother travel to the searing, arid coast of southern Spain to see a famous consultant--their very last chance--in the hope that he might cure her unpredictable limb paralysis. But Dr. Gomez has strange methods that seem to have little to do with physical medicine, and as the treatment progresses, Sofia's mother's illness becomes increasingly baffling. Sofia's role as detective--tracking her mother's symptoms in an attempt to find the secret motivation for her pain--deepens as she discovers her own desires in this transient desert community. Hot Milk is a profound exploration of the sting of sexuality, of unspoken female rage, of myth and modernity, the lure of hypochondria and big pharma, and, above all, the value of experimenting with life; of being curious, bewildered, and vitally alive to the world.",

His ability to control technology attracts the attention of the minister of defense and thrusts him into the magical elite of the nation of Carolinia. The son of undocumented immigrants, Noam has spent his life fighting for the rights of refugees fleeing magical outbreaks--refugees Carolinia routinely deports with vicious efficiency. Sensing a way to make change, Noam accepts the minister's offer to teach him the science behind his magic, secretly planning to use it against the government. But then he meets the minister's son--cruel, dangerous, and achingly beautiful--and the way forward becomes less clear. Caught between his purpose and his heart, Noam must decide who he can trust and how far he's willing to go in pursuit of the greater good.",

                "comment":"<p>Definitely more of a 4.5.<br \/><br \/>CW: mention of past suicide, drug use, pedophilia, abuse<br \/><br \/>I bought this book immediately upon its release but never got around to reading it, though I never had any concrete reason not to. It was probably the hype or the fact that it was sci-fi that made me a bit skeptical but I don\u2019t think I ever doubted that I wouldn\u2019t like it. But now that the release date of its sequel is near, and I\u2019m trying to reduce my huge owned tbr by atleast a bit, I decided it was time to pick it up and it completely blew my mind. <br \/><br \/>I have to mention that my interest in the book went up by many notches when I listened to a couple of panels attended by the author Victoria Lee at the Baltimore book festival. I was left very impressed by their conviction to create worlds which are queer normative, where marginalized people get to be full fledged characters with the color of their skin or sexual\/gender orientation is only one part of their identity and where they get to do all the things that usually white cis het characters get to do in science fiction. And the author very well succeeds at that endeavor in this story. <br \/><br \/>Immigration and refugee crisis form the crux of this story - how countries which are built upon the principles of equal rights can forget their roots due to corruption, fear and manipulation; the Carolinia First ideology in the book was too real and scary to contemplate because we see it playing out in front of our eyes everyday; how the inhumane treatment of refugees results in catastrophes and countries end up blaming it back on them, resulting in a vicious cycle that only leads to more abuse and even deaths of refugees. The author also showcases the affects of long term abuse in a very visceral manner, which just made me feel more helpless. <br \/><br \/>I had been trying to read a couple of adult fantasy books but was finding myself not at all able to follow their style of writing, so when I finally decided to pick this up and had reached 30% of the book before I even realized it, I understood why I love YA SFF so much (and also that\u2019s it\u2019s ok to not want to read outside my comfort zone). The writing is easy to follow, the pacing is a bit on the slower side, and while I knew what the endgame was supposed to be, I couldn\u2019t truly understand the big picture. There is a layer of mystery and uncertainty throughout, we are never sure who to trust or who might be the villain, which country is the big bad - and I think the author did an amazing job keeping that suspense till almost the end. The world building is not very expansive but we are able to glean what is necessary for the story from historical documents interspersed between chapters and other small infodumps. We also don\u2019t really get to know all the possible magical abilities and the consequences of using it too much, but I really enjoyed the abilities of the main character. And wow that ending. I found the book very interesting but it was the tension filled last few chapters and that absolutely heartbreaking ending that has made this a favorite. <br \/><br \/>Noam is a survivor - a child of undocumented immigrants who knows what living in poverty means, he lives through his mother\u2019s suicide and his father\u2019s complete catatonic state and ultimately surviving alone during a virus outbreak. Even being accepted into the government\u2019s elite magical training and being the powerful defense minister\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9e is not enough to make him forget his roots or the anger he feels towards the government which is directly responsible for the inhumane plight of the refugees. His determination to fight for their rights and use all his new found abilities to take down the establishment from the inside  is very admirable. But he is also sixteen, naive and an idealist, justifying to himself that sometimes bad things have to be done for the greater good. He is such a complex character with flaws and we get to know all sides of him, making us want to root for him whole heartedly while also hoping that he doesn\u2019t go down too dark a path. It\u2019s really been a while since I\u2019ve read such a character and I tip off my hat to the author for writing him. <br \/><br \/>I really have no words to describe Dara except maybe a tortured soul. He moves in the world with a carefree mask on his face, only showing his true vulnerable side in little moments, struggling to tell anyone about all the secrets he is protecting, all the while also trying to work on his amazing magical abilities. We never get to read his POV but as a reader we can tell that he is suffering and just want to hold and comfort him somehow. <br \/><br \/>Noam and Dara\u2019s relationship is not something that develops steadily through communication like in other books. It\u2019s depicted in small moments of tenderness, affection, anger, helplessness and everything in between and it was so beautiful to read. Whatever the flaws in each of their characters, they are selfless in their love and I can\u2019t reiterate enough that the ending broke my heart.<br \/><br \/>Lehrer is a fascinating character who I still can\u2019t describe properly without giving away the plot. Just trust me when I say that nothing is at it seems and it was both enjoyable and uncomfortable to read about such a person. There are a few others with magical abilities in the story and while I enjoyed the scenes that Noam or Dara shared with them, no one really left a big impression on me. I really hope we get more fleshed out side characters in the future. <br \/><br \/>To conclude, I already had expectations going into this book but it really surpassed them. If you enjoy character focused YA sci-fi stories with a diverse cast, with a post apocalyptic world that also feels close to our own political reality, a story where you don\u2019t know who to trust - then this book is perfect for you. I\u2019m completely devastated after that end but I also have hope, and because I\u2019m too impatient to wait, I\u2019m going to pick up my arc of the sequel right this moment.<\/p>",

Definitely did not love it, but perhaps this was just because I was thinking too hard?<br \/><br \/>First of all, I am very very sorry that I did not love it. I actually <i>did<\/i> love it, up until page 290 and I started to rethink my entire experience for reasons that I don\u2019t think anyone else has pointed out before me. <b>On one hand, I really really liked the first half of the book. But on the other hand, I\u2019ve never finished a book and had so many negative things to say about it.<\/b> I could make a list but I would not want to crush the spirits of everyone who gave this book 5 stars. <br \/><br \/>Chai, an ever-fantastic reviewer and blogger, has a great review for this book, and I think it also explains a lot of my feelings, so go read that review, too.<br \/><br \/>___<br \/><br \/><b>The first half was great.<\/b> I had very few problems, and I really liked the pacing of getting to know Noam, the other characters, and their world at that point. In those moments, the world building was cool! I liked the science magic. That was interesting. Everything was interesting to me at first! All of the makings of a great book! <br \/><br \/><b>Noam! I did like him.<\/b> Nicely-written main character, most of the time. I also liked Dara. Some of the time. Overall, I appreciated these characters and their identities. I appreciated what they represent in the story, Noam as a refugee and both of them as queer POC main characters, teens trying to find their way in a broken world. A lot of the struggles they faced, and especially with Noam because he was The main character, were very real and definitely speak to immigration and general adolescent issues we have today. <br \/><br \/>But it\u2019s\u2026 becoming hard to explain anything <i>else<\/i> I <i>did<\/i> like about this book, so let\u2019s get into something else. <br \/><br \/><b>I think my main issue was the writing style.<\/b> It was the root of most of my problems. It caused me to think too hard about what was going on, and it always felt like I was missing something, a bit of information that was left out or that was implied but not enough. (lol maybe i\u2019m just dumb)<br \/><br \/>There was a <b>scene<\/b> toward the last third of the book which made me <i>really<\/i> question what the heck was going on with the writing. Without spoiling anything, Noam accidentally discovers that someone he knows is in a potentially abusive relationship, and his first reaction to finding this out is\u2026 off-putting and bizarre, especially considering how upset he is about this discovery a few pages later. In the most non-spoilery way possible, this would be equivalent to someone finding a youtube video of a person in a dangerous situation on the street and saying \u201cthat person looks like someone hot I know\u201d. Like\u2026 ?????? That\u2019s a completely irrelevant and irrational thought to have??? Upon seeing potential danger???? I reread that scene 10 times and it never once made sense. I\u2019ve read like 15 reviews for this book and no one is mentioning this, either. <br \/><br \/>And after that scene, everything felt a little off to me, and it had almost nothing to do with the previously described scene. The character movements and dialogue were stiff or strangely sudden. <b>Sometimes my mind was just ????? for no good reason.<\/b> <br \/><br \/>Perhaps I am too sensitive. Perhaps I am too critical. I will accept both of these criticisms, but\u2026 I implore you to read that scene I described and <i>not<\/i> have a problem with it. <br \/><br \/>Anyways! I guess I liked it and I will be reading the second book. <br \/><br \/><b>tl;dr<\/b> If I tried to explain to you every single thing I had an issue with, we would be here for a while. I liked it. The first half was great, the second half was not. Try it for yourself, but read the content warnings first. <br \/><br \/>\u2014  <br \/><i><b>CW: past suicide of loved one, sexual abuse, violence, statutory rape, intergenerational trauma\/genocide, death and murder, death of a child, ableist language, drug and alcohol abuse, pedophilia.<\/b><\/i><br \/><br \/>At this point, I have no idea what\u2019s going on with my rating system.<\/p>",

Heimlich schw\u00e4rmt er f\u00fcr die junge Frau, die jeden Donnerstag bei ihm eine Tasse hei\u00dfen Kakao trinkt. Jede Woche sitzt sie an ihrem Stammplatz und schreibt Briefe.

The Westfall family wanted democracy after the war. The truce between the Westfall family and Lattimer\u2019s was only supposed to be temporary. <br \/><br \/>Now that Ivy is sixteen, she is able to participate in the tradition of marring someone from the wealthy side of the town. She is supposed to marry Bishop Lattimer, the presidents son. Originally her sister was supposed to marry Bishop. Her family has come up with a plan though. To kill Bishop, the president, and to take over their town again.<br \/><br \/>Now you know where this is going\u2026 books like this are pretty predictable but it doesn\u2019t mean I like them any less. I actually really enjoyed The Book of Ivy and I couldn\u2019t put it down the day I decided to read it. I really enjoyed Ivy\u2019s character and personality. Her family made her seem like she was weak and would not be able to fulfill her duty to kill Bishop but I knew she was stronger than they thought. <br \/><br \/>Bishop was a lovely character to read about. As the book went on, I started to like him more and more. I actually instantly liked him once he we introduced. I know you\u2019re supposed to hate him because he is the enemy of the narrator, but I could tell instantly by the way he acted, that he was not like his father. That he would win over Ivy and that there was a hidden meaning on why he waited to marry her and not her sister, Callie.  <br \/><br \/>I really enjoyed reading about how Bishop and Ivy got to know each other more each day. How they would open up to each other even though they have no had that ability before this marriage. I could tell that Bishop wanted to get to know her right away. He never resented her for the forced marriage that was put on them like in some other books. Which usually makes it easier for the girl to do her job, but in this case, I think Ivy caved quicker than it would of been if he treated her bad. <br \/><br \/>Overall, I really enjoyed this book and I would recommend it. I was interested the second I read the synopsis and I was not let down. The next book comes out in less than a year but I need it now! Can\u2019t wait to see what happens to Ivy and how Bishop will be in the next book. Pick it up!<\/p>",

One of the most underestimated\u2014and challenging\u2014positions in the world, the First Lady of the United States must be many things: an inspiring leader with a forward-thinking agenda of her own; a savvy politician, skilled at navigating the treacherous rapids of Washington; a wife and mother operating under constant scrutiny; and an able CEO responsible for the smooth operation of countless services and special events at the White House. Now, as she did in her smash #1 bestseller The Residence, former White House correspondent Kate Andersen Brower draws on a wide array of untapped, candid sources\u2014from residence staff and social secretaries to friends and political advisers\u2014to tell the stories of the ten remarkable women who have defined that role since 1960. Brower offers new insights into this privileged group of remarkable women, including Jacqueline Kennedy, Lady Bird Johnson, Patricia Nixon, Betty Ford, Rosalynn Carter, Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush, Hillary Clinton, Laura Bush, and Michelle Obama. The stories she shares range from the heartwarming to the shocking and tragic, exploring everything from the first ladies\u2019 political crusades to their rivalries with Washington figures; from their friendships with other first ladies to their public and private relationships with their husbands. She also offers insight as to what Melania Trump might hope to accomplish as First Lady. Candid and illuminating, this first group biography of the modern first ladies provides a revealing look at life upstairs and downstairs at the world\u2019s most powerful address.",

It has great composition as well.<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>What a delightful little novella this turned out to be. It was sweet. It was well written and nicely paced. It had two extremely likable main characters. It had a great cast of secondary characters. It had smokin\u2019 hot sex scenes. No OW\/OM drama. Very little angst. All wrapped up in a nice epilogue. Two thumbs up from yours truly.<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>",

I wish that he has spent more time talking about how to find your way back to God, but that is part of his book, that it cannot be prescribed.  <br \/><br \/>I unintentionally read it which Eugene Peterson\u2019s Practice Resurrection.  I highly recommend doing that.  Peterson\u2019s books primarily says you cannot grow without the church.  Spencer says that the church often gets in the road of actually spiritual growth.  I think they are both right in their own way.

I\u2019m a man with too many secrets, so the last thing I need is a new roommate with a sexy smile and blue eyes that see right through me. Eight years ago, Roderick left town after high school. We\u2019re not friends. I owe him nothing. But back then, I let one of my secrets slip, and he\u2019s the only one who noticed. Part of me knows I should run far, far away. But the other part wants him to come upstairs and spend the night. But if I let him in, I could lose everything. Seeking: a room to rent in town. I\u2019m tidy, have no pets, and I will feed you homemade bread. I should probably add: Gay AF, and has no filter. It\u2019s no wonder my new landlord is so wary of me. A smarter man would ignore those hot glances from Kieran Shipley. The broody lumberjack wants more from me than another homemade pretzel, but if I push my luck, I\u2019ll end up back on the street. Too bad I\u2019ve never been smart with my heart\u2026 Passionate, sexy, and emotional, Roommate brings all the feels and all the delicious heat!

The wealth of his treasury and the strength of his armies dazzled historians, poets, courtiers, diplomats, and publics across Eurasia. S\u00fcleyman fought with the Catholic Habsburgs in Europe and the Shiite Safavids in the Middle East, while presiding over a multilinguistic and multireligious empire. During his reign, imperial governance expanded considerably, and the law was emphasized as the main bond between ruler and subject. S\u00fcleyman's prolific poetic output, his frequent appearances during public ceremonies, his charity, and his patronage of arts and architecture enhanced his reputation as a universal ruler who promised peace and prosperity to his subjects\"--",

                "comment":"<p><br \/><br \/> <br \/><br \/>I am not a HUGE fan of this cover to be honest. Yes, it\u2019s a good representation of the story, but I am not digging the font used or the place of the author\u2019s name. I think the sidebar thing throws the composition off and the author\u2019s name would have looked better under the title and the tagline. I also believe a thicker font would have looked better as well.<br \/><br \/>I really struggled to decide on a rating for this one. I enjoyed it a lot overall. There were a couple of issues that I will address in a bit and one in particular that brought my rating down some. <br \/><br \/>This book was a MUCH heavier book than I anticipated. To be honest by the end, I was mentally drained. It was also VERY well written. Had an interesting plot. Had flawed but likable characters. Alex and Lincoln (from book one) make appearances. It had SMOKIN\u2019 sex scenes. It had angst. It had drama. It had feels. It had a sweet two years in the future epilogue.<br \/><br \/>So what stopped this from being a 5-Star book? It was L-O-N-G. Like epically LONG. Like SO long I though my husband and kids might just find a skeleton holding a tablet when they finally discovered they hadn\u2019t seen me in awhile. Becuase of the length of this one not finding out about Dakota\u2019s secret until 80% was FRUSTRATING. On top of that Dakota doesn\u2019t let Trystan fully in until right at the end of the book. With a book of this length that was just too long IMO.<br \/><br \/> <br \/><br \/>The second issue and this is where I am going to gently suggest to the author that she add a trigger warning to the blurb. I REALLY didn\u2019t need to know in such graphic details what happened to Dakota. Knowing in the most basic of details was MORE than enough. I had to set the book aside because I was crying and sick to my stomach. When I read a good dark romance, I go in mentally prepared for this type of stuff. This was unexpected. Of course, I had guessed what had taken place early on, but like I said the details were just too much IMO.<br \/><br \/>So overall this was a great read with a lot more depth and complexity than I had anticipated. I thought I was going to get a smokin\u2019 hot sexy read and I got that and SO much more. Two thumbs up from yours truly. <br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>",

This novel is loaded with triggering content: child abuse, rape, animal cruelty, homicide, sexual abuse, etc. Reading this story was very off-putting, yet it was also extremely compelling. I read this book quickly and couldn\u2019t put it down. The author\u2019s skill is evident throughout, beautiful prose and expert pacing transform this depressing tale into something that feels profoundly human. I was frustrated this book, in many ways I felt it represented some of the worst aspects of human nature. Yet just because these characteristics are bad, does not mean they are not true. True Crime seemed to tap into something about the human experience that resonated with me, even if it was antithetical to how I strive to live me life. Pain, fear, indifference, and violence abound. Yet this ultimately a portrayal of the struggle to love and be loved. Overall I give this book \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f.<\/p>",

Non-existent. It\u2019s like she scribbled down the plot points and what the characters were supposed to be like, her thoughts about trauma and sexual violence and how she wanted the character to think, mashed it together and published it. The story was so poorly written that I could barely tell what was happening because events would get one line to a couple of paragraphs maximum.<\/p>",

Son exploration entra\u00eene le chercheur, bien au-del\u00e0 des simples sph\u00e8res aristocratiques, jusqu'au coeur des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s traditionnelles. Les neuf \u00abregards\u00bb rassembl\u00e9s dans ce livre en fournissent la d\u00e9monstration, que les auteurs se proposent de porter \u00e0 la connaissance du public des recherches en cours, qu'ils tentent une synth\u00e8se de travaux publi\u00e9s ou qu'ils s'attachent \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper des probl\u00e9matiques renouvel\u00e9es gr\u00e2ce aux m\u00e9thodes d'investigation de la sociologie ou de l'anthropologie sociale que les historiens savent fort bien aujourd'hui adapter aux exigences de leur discipline. On a choisi d'adopter une chronologie longue, des temps f\u00e9odaux \u00e0 l'aube du XXe si\u00e8cle, et de varier les angles d'approche, des statuts juridiques et des liens d'homme \u00e0 homme au cadre domestique, des options politiques aux engagements \u00e9conomiques, des contrastes sociaux \u00e0 l'id\u00e9alisation d'un mod\u00e8le de vie. Il s'agit avant tout de souligner la diversit\u00e9 des formes du questionnement historique et de montrer, au travers des acquis et des interrogations qui demeurent, que les archives bretonnes sont encore loin d'avoir livr\u00e9 tous leurs secrets, et que la r\u00e9flexion sur les syst\u00e8mes et les comportements aristocratiques, loin d'\u00eatre obsol\u00e8te ou d\u00e9nu\u00e9e d'int\u00e9r\u00eat, reste d'une \u00e9vidente actualit\u00e9 pour nos soci\u00e9t\u00e9s pl\u00e9b\u00e9iennes et d\u00e9mocratiques.",

Adamant about women being independent-and without a romantic bone in her lovely body-she had sternly refused to give her moonstruck sixteen-year-old ward permission to wed an eighteen-year-old suitor. Now the desperate teens have dreamed up a mock robbery and a daring rescue to change Beatrice's mind.Attorney Connor Barrow, a rogue of an Irishman with a silver tongue, remembers all too well the burning desires of youth.  So he agrees to help in a crazy plan that will land him in a world of trouble. Suddenly he is responsible for the most influential lady in the city being locked up in a brothel, furious and threatening his ruin.  Neither of them expects that first breathless kiss-a deal that would make the devil himself blush-and, most of all, the ways love can change a man's mind and open a woman's heart....From the Paperback edition.",

        "description":"From the author of Hyperfocus, a treasure trove of practical, science-backed strategies that reveal how the key to a less anxious life, and even greater productivity, is a calm state of mind \u201cAfter rebounding from his own burnout, Bailey devised a clear-eyed, concise method that marries science and self-help; he\u2019s equally proficient in probing the roles of serotonin and endorphins while charting concrete steps in chapters titled \u2018The Mindset of More\u2019 and \u2018Heights of Stimulation.\u2019 Slow down, breathe, and submerge into these pages.\u201d \u2014Oprah Daily A PENGUIN LIFE BOOK It took an on-stage panic attack for productivity expert Chris Bailey to recognize how critical it is to invest in calm at the same time that we invest in becoming more productive. Productivity advice works\u2014and we need it now more than ever\u2014but it\u2019s just as vital that we develop our capacity for calm. By finding calm and overcoming anxiety, we don\u2019t just feel more comfortable in our own mind\u2014we build a deeper, more expansive reservoir of energy to draw from throughout the day. The pursuit of calm ultimately leads us to become more engaged, focused, and deliberate\u2014while making us more satisfied with our lives. And because calm saves us time by making us more productive, we don\u2019t even need to feel guilty about the time we spend investing in it. How to Calm Your Mind is our crucial guide to achieving calm, navigating anxiety, and staving off burnout. It explains how our digital world drains us, and what we can do to abate the hidden sources of stress that burden our days. Bailey has learned to embrace the analog world and \u201cstimulation fasts,\u201d to use the science of \u201csavoring\u201d to become more focused and present, and to relax without guilt\u2014and he shows us how we can reclaim calm, too. In an anxious world, investing in calm might be the best productivity strategy around.",

I am also happy that most of the \u201cStudies say\u201d or \u201cresearch shows\u201d quotes are properly referenced to those studies\u2026 But given that Chris humble brags about this \u201cIf I had to name one thing I uniquely enjoy doing that other people can\u2019t stand (after reading academic journal articles)\u201d I would expect more accuracy in the sources and also some more challenge with some counter argument studies to make us choose sides with a coherent analysis of those studies. Nevertheless a great book and it comes at the right time as we all need calm right now.<\/p>",

        "publicationYear":2018,
        "description":"This book examines immigrant student achievement and education policy across a range of Western nations. It is divided into 3 sections: Part 1 introduces the topic of immigrant student achievement and the performance disadvantage that is consistently reported across a range of international jurisdictions. Part 2 then presents national profiles from scholars in ten countries (England, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Finland, Netherlands, Republic of Ireland, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand). These educational jurisdictions were selected because they represent a range of Western nations engaged in large-scale reform efforts geared towards enhancing their immigrant students\u2019 achievement. Each of the national profiles provides a brief overview of the evolution of the cultural composition of their respective school-aged student population; explains the trajectory of achievement results in non-immigrant and immigrant student groups in relation to both national and international large-scale assessment measures; and discusses the effectiveness of policy responses that have been adopted to close the achievement gap between non-immigrant and immigrant student populations. It also examines the relationships between education policies and immigrant student achievement and discusses how education policies have evolved across various cultural contexts. In conclusion, Part 3 analyzes cross-cultural approaches designed to address the performance disadvantage of immigrant students and proposes future areas of inquiry stemming from the national profiles. The book offers insights into a diverse cross-section of nations and policy approaches to addressing the performance disadvantage.",

        "description":"The award-winning author of modern classics such as Schindler\u2019s List and Napoleon\u2019s Last Island is at his triumphant best with this \u201cengrossing and transporting\u201d (Financial Times) novel about the adventures of Charles Dickens\u2019s son in the Australian Outback during the 1860s. Edward Dickens, the tenth child of England\u2019s most famous author Charles Dickens, has consistently let his parents down. Unable to apply himself at school and adrift in life, the teenaged boy is sent to Australia in the hopes that he can make something of himself\u2014or at least fail out of the public eye. He soon finds himself in the remote Outback, surrounded by Aboriginals, colonials, ex-convicts, ex-soldiers, and very few women. Determined to prove to his parents and more importantly, himself, that he can succeed in this vast and unfamiliar wilderness, Edward works hard at his new life amidst various livestock, bushrangers, shifty stock agents, and frontier battles. By reimagining the tale of a fascinating yet little-known figure in history, this \u201croguishly tender coming-of-age story\u201d (Booklist) offers penetrating insights into Colonialism and the fate of Australia\u2019s indigenous people, and a wonderfully intimate portrait of Charles Dickens, as seen through the eyes of his son.",

The second book in the Quantum Earth series, what I suspect will be at least a trilogy, this novel adds great character and plot development even if it does sometimes seem a bit repetitive.

        "description":"A riveting true story of industrial espionage in which a Chinese-born scientist is pursued by the U.S. government for trying to steal trade secrets, by a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in nonfiction. In September 2011, sheriff\u2019s deputies in Iowa encountered three ethnic Chinese men near a field where a farmer was growing corn seed under contract with Monsanto. What began as a simple trespassing inquiry mushroomed into a two-year FBI operation in which investigators bugged the men\u2019s rental cars, used a warrant intended for foreign terrorists and spies, and flew surveillance planes over corn country\u2014all in the name of protecting trade secrets of corporate giants Monsanto and DuPont Pioneer. In The Scientist and the Spy, Hvistendahl gives a gripping account of this unusually far-reaching investigation, which pitted a veteran FBI special agent against Florida resident Robert Mo, who after his academic career foundered took a questionable job with the Chinese agricultural company DBN\u2014and became a pawn in a global rivalry. Industrial espionage by Chinese companies lies beneath the United States\u2019 recent trade war with China, and it is one of the top counterintelligence targets of the FBI. But a decade of efforts to stem the problem have been largely ineffective. Through previously unreleased FBI files and her reporting from across the United States and China, Hvistendahl describes a long history of shoddy counterintelligence on China, much of it tinged with racism, and questions the role that corporate influence plays in trade secrets theft cases brought by the U.S. government. The Scientist and the Spy is both an important exploration of the issues at stake and a compelling, involving read.",

Harrington Award from the Caucus for a New Political Science of APSA Examines the tenets of civil society as they have been understood in the past two and a half millennia In the absence of noble public goals, admired leaders, and compelling issues, many warn of a dangerous erosion of civil society. Are they right? What are the roots and implications of their insistent alarm? How can public life be enriched in a period marked by fraying communities, widespread apathy, and unprecedented levels of contempt for politics? How should we be thinking about civil society? Civil Society examines the historical, political, and theoretical evolution of how civil society has been understood for the past two and a half millennia. From Aristotle and the Enlightenment philosophers to Colin Powell's Volunteers for America, Ehrenberg provides an indispensable analysis of the possibilities-and limits-of what this increasingly important idea can offer to contemporary political affairs.",

        "title":"Train Your Mind, Change Your Brain",
        "publicationYear":2008,
        "description":"Is it really possible to change the structure and function of the brain, and in so doing alter how we think and feel? The answer is a resounding yes. In late 2004, leading Western scientists joined the Dalai Lama at his home in Dharamsala, India, to address this very question--and in the process brought about a revolution in our understanding of the human mind. In this fascinating and far-reaching book, Wall Street Journal science writer Sharon Begley reports on how cutting-edge science and the ancient wisdom of Buddhism have come together to show how we all have the power to literally change our brains by changing our minds. These findings hold exciting implications for personal transformation.For decades, the conventional wisdom of neuroscience held that the hardware of the brain is fixed and immutable--that we are stuck with what we were born with. As Begley shows, however, recent pioneering experiments in neuroplasticity, a new science that investigates whether and how the brain can undergo wholesale change, reveal that the brain is capable not only of altering its structure but also of generating new neurons, even into old age. The brain can adapt, heal, renew itself after trauma, and compensate for disability. Begley documents how this fundamental paradigm shift is transforming both our understanding of the human mind and our approach to deep-seated emotional, cognitive, and behavioral problems. These breakthroughs show that it is possible to reset our happiness meter, regain the use of limbs disabled by stroke, train the mind to break cycles of depression and OCD, and reverse age-related changes in the brain. They also suggest that it is possible to teach and learn compassion, a key step in the Dalai Lama's quest for a more peaceful world. But as we learn from studies performed on Buddhist monks, an important component in changing the brain is to tap the power of mind and, in particular, focused attention. This is the classic Buddhist practice of mindfulness, a technique that has become popular in the West and that is immediately available to everyone.  With her extraordinary gift for making science accessible, meaningful, and compelling, Sharon Begley illuminates a profound shift in our understanding of how the brain and the mind interact. This tremendously hopeful book takes us to the leading edge of a revolution in what it means to be human.From the Hardcover edition.",

But Angela Merkel was not born a Chancellor. In her memoirs, co-written with her long-standing political advisor Beate Baumann, she looks back on her life in two German states \u2013 35 years in the GDR (German Democratic Republic), 35 years in reunified Germany. More personally than ever before, she talks about her childhood, youth, and her studies in the GDR, and the dramatic year of 1989, when the Wall fell and her political life began. She shares insights into her meetings and conversations with the world's most powerful leaders and elucidates, with clear and precise examples, significant national, European, and international turning points and how decisions were made that shape our times. Her book offers a unique insight into the inner workings of power \u2013 and is a decisive plea for freedom. \u201cWhat does freedom mean to me? This question has occupied me my entire life. Naturally, politically, because freedom needs democratic conditions, without democracy there is no freedom, no rule of law, no protection of human rights. But this question also occupies me on another level. Freedom, for me, is finding out where my own limits are, and pushing my own limits. Freedom is for me not to stop learning, not to have to stand still but to be allowed to continue, even after leaving politics.\u201d - Angela Merkel",

Stories are not only to be recounted and passed down; they are also intended as tools for teaching. Jo-ann Archibald worked closely with elders and storytellers, who shared both traditional and personal life- experience stories, in order to develop ways of bringing storytelling into educational contexts. Indigenous Storywork is the result of this research and it demonstrates how stories have the power to educate and heal the heart, mind, body, and spirit. It builds on the seven principles of respect, responsibility, reciprocity, reverence, holism, interrelatedness, and synergy that form a framework for understanding the characteristics of stories, appreciating the process of storytelling, establishing a receptive learning context, and engaging in holistic meaning-making.",

I discovered that this novel is the third in a series but also connected to a Christmas novella and a second series as well bringing characters together and I love things like that. Even though I not read the other books in the series I was more than able to appreciate the characters and believe that I would like to read more about them in the other books related. <br \/><br \/>Being regency with all the etiquette and silly banter this story is fully of wit. Romantic and comical each page will present the reader with smiles. There is also a good touching on issues and causes of things such as child labor, mill revolts, long hours, as well as places for a person to improve. Using womanly whiles for the purpose of stumping men and exiting the acquaintance without a second thought. Learning to grow and find true forgiveness for a variety of past sins are woven through out and the message is not overly preachy yet important to experience. <br \/><br \/>The Courteous Cad is indeed a courteous man in the end. Both titles he earns and though the story is reflected on him, you can see learning and redeeming qualities in more character than one. I recommend this novel and must find some more.<\/p>",

        "description":"\"Killed in Action -- the most dreaded words imaginable for a soldier's wife. Jess Albert has been living with them for four years, since the death of her husband in Afghanistan. Finding blessed numbness in routine, she doesn't dare to look ahead, any more than she can bear to look back. Then Tyler Brown, a former special-ops warrior, shows up at her small general store in Minnesota North Woods, jarring her back to life. Jess knows better than to fall in love with another man who places duty to his country before love of his wife- but there's no denying the longing and the hope for a future that Ty makes her feel. A world away, a man ravaged by years of captivity and torture, a man with no memories, finally escapes- clinging to life and sanity in a hostile land. In his darkest hour, he awakes in a lantern-lit cave to find a woman at his side. Dark-haired and dark-eyes, her touch is caring, despite the resentment he hears in her voice and sees on her face. Rabia is bound by honor to save the lost American soldier in her keeping, this broken warrior from a war that has brought so much devastation to her land. But is it honor igniting her compassion for her enemy, or is it something more? While a Black Ops team plans a daring rescue mission to bring the solider home, two women on opposite sides of the world walk a dangerous path between betrayal and honor, and must find for themselves where to draw the lines between duty and love. New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Cindy Gerard's latest novel is a heartwarming, richly emotional, action-packed story about homecomings- just in time for the holidays\"--\n\n\"Four years ago Jess Albert got the news that her husband Jeff was killed in action in Afghanistan, and a painful void entered her life. The more time passed, the more acutely she felt that emptiness. But when Tyler Brown, former military hero and all-around alpha male, shows up a year after she'd last seen him, Jess gradually begins to realize there is one thing that can make her feel whole again--love. As they're planning their wedding and new life together, Jess receives shocking news: her husband is alive, under the care of a young Afghani woman hiding him from the Taliban. Even as he sees their happily-ever-after slip away, Ty arranges for the One Eyed Jacks and Black Ops, Inc. teams to make a daring and dangerous rescue mission to bring Jeff home. The hardest thing Ty or Jess has ever done is to let the other go. When Jeff returns to Jess, broken physically and emotionally and with no memory of their history, they try to heal their marriage and each other. But as time brings them together more as friends than lovers, an unexpected development helps them see the true way home, to the people they love\"--",

Bellavia and his men confronted an enemy who had had weeks to prepare, booby-trapping houses, arranging ambushes, rigging entire city blocks as explosive-laden kill zones, and even stocking up on steroids. Entering one house, alone, Bellavia faced the fight of his life against six insurgents, using every weapon at his disposal, including a knife. Bringing to life the terrifying intimacy of hand-to-hand infantry combat, and populated by a well-drawn cast of characters, this is more than just another war story. The book develops the intensely close relationships that form between soldiers under fire, in a harrowing story of triumph, tragedy, and the resiliency of the human spirit.--From publisher description.",

A catastrophe that needs to be covered up at all costs. 2017. Phiney is shocked by the death of her grandfather, Wilf, who has jumped from a railway bridge at a Coventry station. Journalist Mat Torrington is the only witness. Left with a swarm of unanswered questions, Phiney, Mat and Wilf's wife, Dora, begin their own enquiries into Wilf's death. It is soon clear that these two events, sixty years apart, are connected - and that Wilf is not the only casualty. But what is the link? And can they find out before any more lives are lost? A Quiet Contagion is a powerfully disquieting mystery for modern times, inspired by the 1957 Coventry polio epidemic and the 1955 Cutter Incident (one of the worst pharmaceutical disasters in US history - which saw thousands of American children mistakenly infected with a live polio vaccine) as well as the more recent global coronavirus pandemic. PRAISE FOR JANE JESMOND 'An original voice in crime fiction' - Sunday Times on Cut Adrift (A Best Crime Novel of 2023) 'Jesmond's delineation of her characters as people with plausible flaws and hot tempers adds depth and complexity to a story that might wear its sentiments on its sleeves, yet which is trimly steered and freighted with contemporary resonance' - Times on Cut Adrift (Thriller Book of the Month) 'In an over-saturated market, finding a new voice with something compelling to say in the crime writing field can be difficult. Thankfully there are people out there trying to deliver a twist on the genre, and Jane Jesmond is one of them' - On Yorkshire Magazine on Cut Adrift 'This amazing debut novel from Jane Jesmond will give you all the thrills you've been looking for and keep you gripped from the get-go' - Female First on On The Edge 'Evocative, compelling and pulse-pounding' - Philippa East on On The Edge",

Alexander's harrowing study shows how only minor tactical changes in Hitler's military approach could have changed the world we live in today.\".\n\n\"How Hitler Could Have Won World War II untangles some of the war's most confounding strategic questions, such as: Why didn't the Nazis concentrate their enormous military power on the only three beaches upon which the Allies could launch their attack into Europe? Why did the terrifying German panzers, on the brink of driving the British army into the sea in May 1940, halt their advance and allow the British to regroup and evacuate at Dunkirk?\n\nWith the chance to cut off the Soviet lifeline of oil, and therefore any hope of Allied victory from the east, why did Hitler insist on dividing and weakening his army, which ultimately led to the horrible battle of Stalingrad?\"--BOOK JACKET.",

                "comment":"<p>So this was a quick read.  I enjoyed the camping horror aspects. That being said, I was a bit perplexed how three people weren\u2019t trying to take this man down together. I suppose the moral of the story precludes what some people would actually do. I get Imogen being compliant. And I get that Gale was apparently strong, and he also had weapons. I don\u2019t necessarily believe he managed to kill a cop with just a knife. I think the cop would have killed him first. I mean, they aren\u2019t known for their subtlety. <br \/><br \/>No one really knows what they\u2019d do in that situation. But most of it could have been avoided with better choices. Bad choices were consistently made. Choices I can\u2019t imagine anyone would actually make. Okay, yeah, you need your iodine tabs back. But don\u2019t walk into an unknown situation with a known thief who is obviously hiding from everyone. Mindboggling choices, especially from Beck, the supposed smart, knowledgeable one. Sometimes incredibly selfish choices, which I get. But part of me is just like, \u2018I thought you loved each other?\u2019 Were it me and my wife (HAHA! camping is terrifying, and this novel is proof to this absolute fop), I would be ready to rip someone\u2019s throat out if they threatened her. And that\u2019s not me being macho, that\u2019s just me being a protective wife with a tendency toward berserker rage in a given situation.<br \/><br \/>The hero of the story, Imogen, is not quite gaslighted by her friend and sister; but neither woman really ever wants to consider that she\u2019s right about a situation. To their extreme detriment. <br \/><br \/>So, yeah, choices made, made no sense.<br \/><br \/>THAT being said. Because I do not liking camping, this was horror for me. Even before they ran into the villain, I was disturbed and horrified. Even though I grew up in the country on a mountain in a skiing town. I enjoy the details about camping, because I don\u2019t know them, since I don\u2019t like camping. This was a fun read, just not a great read.<br \/><br \/>Seriously, though, Beck is a dolt.<br \/><br \/><em>edit<\/em><br \/><br \/>After having my wife read this and discussing it last night when we should have been sleeping, I have dropped the rating down. Absolutely, there seems to be some toxic positivity going on here. And some mental health shaming, which perhaps the author didn\u2019t intend. But clearly, they all need therapy, and Imogen shouldn\u2019t throw away something that helps her cope, like her CBD. But the fact that she WASN\u2019T already in therapy and on medication is ridiculous. She didn\u2019t seem to be broke; but even if she were, surely Pittsburgh has options that are either free or have a sliding scale for payment. And that ending. Woo, that ending. Lying to their significant others after a traumatic experience; not bothering to seek therapy afterwards; hoping that somehow, randomly, the poor dead hiker gets found (they\u2019re lucky he DID); being happy and healthy and besties again? No, nope, no way. Tilda is a trashfire; Beck is a self-righteous, know-it-all; Imogen, the smartest, honestly, feels empowered by killing a person\u2013an asshole, to be sure\u2013but really, she\u2019d probably just be traumatized even more. I don\u2019t buy that ending. If they never spoke again, and the sisters had very strained relations\u2013I\u2019d believe that. If Jamal broke up with Tilda, and Afiya divorced Beck because neither dealt with the trauma, I\u2019d believe that. But I don\u2019t buy that ending.<\/p>",

        "publicationYear":2011,
        "description":"In the course of the 20th century, cancer went from being perceived as a white woman's nemesis to a \"democratic disease\" to a fearsome threat in communities of color. Drawing on film and fiction, on medical and epidemiological evidence, and on patients' accounts, Keith Wailoo tracks this transformation in cancer awareness, revealing how not only awareness, but cancer prevention, treatment, and survival have all been refracted through the lens of race. Spanning more than a century, the book offers a sweeping account of the forces that simultaneously defined cancer as an intensely individualized and personal experience linked to whites, often categorizing people across the color line as racial types lacking similar personal dimensions. Wailoo describes how theories of risk evolved with changes in women's roles, with African-American and new immigrant migration trends, with the growth of federal cancer surveillance, and with diagnostic advances, racial protest, and contemporary health activism. The book examines such powerful and transformative social developments as the mass black migration from rural south to urban north in the 1920s and 1930s, the World War II experience at home and on the war front, and the quest for civil rights and equality in health in the 1950s and '60s. It also explores recent controversies that illuminate the diversity of cancer challenges in America, such as the high cancer rates among privileged women in Marin County, California, the heavy toll of prostate cancer among black men, and the questions about why Vietnamese-American women's cervical cancer rates are so high. A pioneering study, How Cancer Crossed the Color Line gracefully documents how race and gender became central motifs in the birth of cancer awareness, how patterns and perceptions changed over time, and how the \"war on cancer\" continues to be waged along the color line.",

Old friends. Old grudges. One evening back together again. The last time they all had dinner, someone wound up dead. What could go wrong? Sophie Lind hasn\u2019t seen her college friends in a decade when a dinner invitation from one of the friends, Ava, arrives on her doorstep. They used to all be inseparable, meeting for dinner every week, even after graduation. But the last time they all had dinner, ten years ago, someone was dead by the end of the night. It was Sophie\u2019s then-fianc\u00e9 William who died that night in his apartment, just a room away from the friends he called family. Sophie isn\u2019t sure if it\u2019s curiosity\u2014or guilt\u2014that pushes her to accept Ava\u2019s dinner invitation and unbury those old wounds. When the six friends arrive for the dinner, there\u2019s a small box waiting for each of them by their plates. Each box uncovers secrets that the friends have kept hidden all these years, and with the door to the apartment locked from the outside, it\u2019s clear that Ava didn\u2019t plan this dinner just to reminisce about the past. What happened to William is buried beneath someone\u2019s lies\u2014and nobody\u2019s leaving this dinner table until the truth comes out.",

        "description":"From the bestselling author of Cultural Literacy, a passionate and cogent argument for reforming the way we teach our children Why, after decades of commissions, reforms, and efforts at innovation, do our schools continue to disappoint us? In this comprehensive and thought-provoking book, educational theorist E. D. Hirsch, Jr. offers a masterful analysis of how American ideas about education have veered off course, what we must do to right them, and most importantly why. He argues that the core problem with American education is that educational theorists, especially in the early grades, have for the past sixty years rejected academic content in favor of \"child-centered\" and \"how-to\" learning theories that are at odds with how children really learn. The result is failing schools and widening inequality, as only children from content-rich (usually better-off) homes can take advantage of the schools' educational methods. Hirsch unabashedly confronts the education establishment, arguing that a content-based curriculum is essential to addressing social and economic inequality. A nationwide, specific, grade-by-grade curriculum established in the early school grades can help fulfill one of America's oldest and most compelling dreams: to give all children, regardless of language, religion, or origins, the opportunity to participate as equals and become competent citizens. Hirsch not only reminds us of these inspiring ideals, he offers an ambitious and specific plan for achieving them.",

A year after the death of his Holocaust-surviving grandmother, Dave leaves Boston for Amsterdam, the home of Anne Frank, whom his Grandma revered. Dave, feeling underserving to confront the suffering that Grandma endured in the concentration camps, cannot bring himself to visit Anne Frank's house. Angry at himself and the world, Dave repeatedly seeks out risky erotic trysts that mix sacred ritual with profane hedonism. Then he meets Alexander, a sexually reserved Dutchman of Indonesian heritage, who has identity conflicts of his own. The relationship shakes both men's lives to their core.",

I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of the financial crime aspect because it felt impersonal and drawn out, but the ending was still satisfying. The carfentanyl plot also felt a little tacked on and ancillary to what the main characters were doing, like it was a thread from the previous book that needed resolving still and shoehorned in. Still, overall a solid book with a solid plot.<\/p>",

        "publicationYear":2013,
        "description":"We are all going to die, but some of us will die better. As a spiritual teacher based in the Washington, D.C., area, Erica Brown has attracted a strong following among those looking for practical wisdom based on the world\u2019s most revered and treasured religious texts. Here she shares stories and ref lections on one of life\u2019s most essential topics: how we pack each day with love and meaning precisely because we will not live forever. Erica helps us confront our fears about death\u2014for ourselves and our loved ones\u2014and demonstrates how the last days of life can be among the most inspiring if we learn to leave a legacy of words and values, to forgive and apologize, and to make important decisions about our last hours. Praised by New York Times columnist David Brooks for combining \u201cextreme empathy with extreme tough-mindedness,\u201d Erica Brown is a leading religious scholar with a sense of humor and a gift for storytelling. In Happier Endings, she meets people of all faiths who deal with death in enlightening ways, including a mother who arranged for her children to sprinkle her ashes on a favorite ski slope, an ex-nun who prepares people to die, a group of women who ritually wash the dead, and a family whose grandfather\u2019s Ethical will is read by his survivors each year. Brown leads readers on an emotional journey to prepare for and accept death, drawing on the wisdom found in many spiritual traditions. The crucial step, Brown writes, is becoming comfortable discussing death\u2014and not just in the abstract. This kind of honesty allows for important conversations, from financial wills to last words that reinforce to those you love most what matters most to you. After reading Happier Endings, you will have a greater understanding of what a good death can be and what a life well lived looks like.",

Sixteen-year-old Zharie Young is absolutely certain her mother morphed into a zombie before her untimely death, but she can't seem to figure out why. Why her mother died, why her aunt doesn't want her around, why all her dreams seem suddenly, hopelessly out of reach. And why, ever since that day, she's been seeing zombies everywhere. Then Bo moves into her apartment building\u2014tall, skateboard in hand, freckles like stars, and an undeniable charm. Z wants nothing to do with him, but when he transforms into a half zombie right before her eyes, something feels different. He contradicts everything she thought she knew about monsters, and she can't help but wonder if getting to know him might unlock the answers to her mother's death. As Zharie sifts through what's real and what's magic, she discovers a new truth about the world: Love can literally change you\u2014for good or for dead. In this surrealist journey of grief, fear, and hope, Britney S. Lewis's debut novel explores love, zombies, and everything in between in an intoxicating amalgam of the real and the fantastic.",

We join her as she navigates a new chapter without her number one, as she moves in with her aunt who is just beginning her adult life, as she finds herself crushing on her first crush, as she starts to see zombies everywhere.  <br \/><br \/>This read like a dream. I was in a haze the entire time. Floating through the minutes and patiently waiting to see where this story took me. It will make you feel so much. Mostly, it made me want to hug her.

        "description":"Vikram Sarabhai (1919-71), the renaissance man of Indian science, thought up the impossible and often made it happen. Founder of India's space programme (ISRO), Vikram dreamed of communication satellites that would educate people at a time when even a modest rocket programme seemed daring; of huge agricultural complexes serviced by atomic power and desalinated sea water. He envisioned research technology that would free Indian industry from foreign dependence, and of a world-class management college that would train managers for the public sector. Between 1947 and 1971, he built a thriving pharmaceutical business, conducted research into cosmic rays, headed the Atomic Energy Commission; set up India's first textile research cooperative, ATIRA, the first market research organization, ORG, the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad (IIM-A) and the dance academy Darpana. Handsome, charismatic, married to pioneering classical dancer Mrinalini Sarabhai and closely associated with the most influential figures of his time\u2014everyone from C.V. Raman and Jawaharlal Nehru to Bruno Rossi, Louis Kahn and John Rockefeller III\u2014Vikram led what seemed like a charmed existence. Yet, his personal life was troubled and his strong resistance to India's move towards a nuclear explosion in the late 1960s put him at odds with powerful lobbies and fellow technologists. In this vivid and intimate account, Amrita Shah delves into the life and mind of a fascinating, complex individual, a multifaceted genius who died young, but whose vision still drives India's ambitious space programme\u2014and continues to inspire India today.",

        "description":"\"During the seventeenth century, Holland created the world's most dynamic colonial empire, outcompeting the British and capturing Spanish and Portuguese colonies. Yet, in the Sino-Dutch War--Europe's first war with China--the Dutch met their match in a colorful Chinese warlord named Koxinga. Part samurai, part pirate, he led his generals to victory over the Dutch and captured one of their largest and richest colonies--Taiwan. How did he do it? Examining the strengths and weaknesses of European and Chinese military techniques during the period, Lost Colony provides a balanced new perspective on long-held assumptions about Western power, Chinese might, and the nature of war. It has traditionally been asserted that Europeans of the era possessed more advanced science, technology, and political structures than their Eastern counterparts, but historians have recently contested this view, arguing that many parts of Asia developed on pace with Europe until 1800. While Lost Colony shows that the Dutch did indeed possess a technological edge thanks to the Renaissance fort and the broadside sailing ship, that edge was neutralized by the formidable Chinese military leadership. Thanks to a rich heritage of ancient war wisdom, Koxinga and his generals outfoxed the Dutch at every turn. Exploring a period when the military balance between Europe and China was closer than at any other point in modern history, Lost Colony reassesses an important chapter in world history and offers valuable and surprising lessons for contemporary times.\"--Jacket.",

        "publicationYear":2013,
        "description":"The ultimate history of the Blitz and bombing in the Second World War, from Wolfson Prize-winning historian and author Richard Overy The use of massive fleets of bombers to kill and terrorize civilians was an aspect of the Second World War which continues to challenge the idea that Allies specifically fought a 'moral' war. For Britain, bombing became perhaps its principal contribution to the fighting as, night after night, exceptionally brave men flew over occupied Europe destroying its cities. The Bombing War radically overhauls our understanding of the War. It is the first book to examine seriously not just the most well-known parts of the campaign, but the significance of bombing on many other fronts - the German use of bombers on the Eastern Front for example (as well as much newly discovered material on the more familiar 'Blitz' on Britain), or the Allied campaigns against Italian cities. The result is the author's masterpiece - a rich, gripping, picture of the Second World War and the terrible military, technological and ethical issues that relentlessly drove all its participants into an abyss. Reviews: 'Magnificent ... must now be regarded as the standard work on the bombing war ... It is probably the most important book published on the history of he second world war this century' Richard J Evans, Guardian 'Monumental ... this is a major contribution to one of the most controversial aspects of the Second World War ... full of new detail and perspectives ... hugely impressive' James Holland, Literary Review 'This tremendous book does what the war it describes signally failed to do. With a well-thought-out strategy and precision, it delivers maximum force on its objectives ... The result is a masterpiece of the historian's art' The Times 'It is unlikely that a work of this scale, scope and merit will be surpassed' Times Higher Education 'What distinguishes Mr Overy's account of the bombing war from lesser efforts is the wealth of narrative detail and analytical rigour that he brings to bear' Economist 'Excellent ... Overy is never less than an erudite and clear-eyed guide whose research is impeccable and whose conclusions appear sensible and convincing even when they run against the established trends' Financial Times 'Hard to surpass. If you want to know how bombing worked, what it did and what it meant, this is the book to read' Times Literary Supplement About the author: Richard Overy is the author of a series of remarkable books on the Second World War and the wider disasters of the twentieth century. The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia won both the Wolfson Prize for History and the Hessell-Tiltman Prize. He is Professor of History at the University of Exeter. Penguin publishes 1939: Countdown to War, The Morbid Age, Russia's War, Interrogations, The Battle of Britain and The Dictators. He lives in London.",

        "publicationYear":1917,
        "description":"This thoughtful study, which antedates the work of Jung by a generation, represents the first serious attempt to correlate the methods of psychoanalysis with the literature of alchemy and of other great Western mystical and occult traditions. Dr. Silberer was a prominent member of the Vienna School whose untimely death prevented this, his major published work, from receiving the attention it clearly merited. Included is a wealth of material taken directly from alchemical and Rosicrucian sources. Symbolisms of salt, sulphur and mercury; of the prison, the abyss and the grave; of putrefaction and procreation; and of the sun, moon, and planets are carefully analyzed and explained. Passages from the works of Hermes Trismegistus, Flamel, Lacinius, Michael Meier, Paracelsus, and Boehme are cited both as important sources of alchemical doctrine and to substantiate the thesis that alchemy was a spiritual discipline of the highest order, comparable to the Yoga of the East. The entire inquiry is based on a parable from the pages of \"Geheime Figuren der Rosenkreuzer,\" an l8th-century alchemical text. After a general exposition of dream and myth interpretation, Dr. Silberer proceeds to a psychoanalytic interpretation of the parable and then gives a detailed account of the traditions and practices of the alchemists, Rosicrucians, and Freemasons. Returning to the parable, he introduces the problem of dual interpretations; for while the psychoanalytic approach focuses on the depths of the impulsive life, the hermetic and mystical leads to the heights of spirituality. The heart of the book is an attempt to reconcile these divergent philosophies and a meditation on the relationship of introversion to mysticism.",

From where did the new desires, values and beliefs, the design methods and building types that make up its cognitive system originate?\" \"In this book Liane Lefaivre and Alexander Tzonis bring together 140 documents spanning a period from the year 1000 to the end of the eighteenth century. They argue that Modern Architectural thinking was created during this period, a wholly new forma mentis for conceiving buildings, landscapes, and cities. The material includes, in addition to the more predictable texts, key extracts from architectural treatises, handbooks, and textbooks, material from letters, articles from the press of the times, scientific memoirs, maxims, poems, plays, and novels. Their authors are equally varied architects, patrons, politicians, artists, poets, scientists, priests, philosophers, and journalists. Some describe and systematize, some argue and criticize, and a large number are eager to present new findings and new ways to construe and construct the world.\" \"Through these diverse records, figures, and voices Lefaivre and Tzonis reconstruct a process of complex and perplexing events, conflicts, experiments, and interactions. They uncover that modernism is by its very nature multiple and identify what they call the cognitive 'co-revolution', a web of parallel revolutionary changes occurring in courts, monasteries, palaces, villas, academies, and workshops. This is the story of the replacement over a period of eight centuries of an 'archaic' design mentality, based on myth and ritual, with today's modern forms of reasoning. Marked with contradictions, Modern Architecture emerges making use of rigorous science but also freewheeling fantasy, driven by the desire for efficiency as well as for luxury and aesthetic delight, for adventure of experiences and for critical reflection, for global universality and for regionalist identity, for totalitarian power and for emancipation of the deprived and the oppressed.\"--BOOK JACKET.",

Now an even greater danger has surfaced: a threat to the existence of the universe itself.\r\nAt the very heart of the galaxy is the Void, a self-contained microuniverse that cannot be breached, cannot be destroyed, and cannot be stopped as it steadily expands in all directions, consuming everything in its path: planets, stars, civilizations. The Void has existed for untold millions of years. Even the oldest and most technologically advanced of the galaxy\u2019s sentient races, the Raiel, do not know its origin, its makers, or its purpose.\r\n\r\nBut then Inigo, an astrophysicist studying the Void, begins dreaming of human beings who live within it. Inigo\u2019s dreams reveal a world in which thoughts become actions and dreams become reality. Inside the Void, Inigo sees paradise. Thanks to the gaiafield, a neural entanglement wired into most humans, Inigo\u2019s dreams are shared by hundreds of millions\u2013and a religion, the Living Dream, is born, with Inigo as its prophet. But then he vanishes.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there is a new wave of dreams. Dreams broadcast by an unknown Second Dreamer serve as the inspiration for a massive Pilgrimage into the Void. But there is a chance that by attempting to enter the Void, the pilgrims will trigger a catastrophic expansion, an accelerated devourment phase that will swallow up thousands of worlds.\r\n\r\nAnd thus begins a desperate race to find Inigo and the mysterious Second Dreamer. Some seek to prevent the Pilgrimage; others to speed its progress\u2013while within the Void, a supreme entity has turned its gaze, for the first time, outward. . . .",

        "description":"Seed and gene banks have made great strides in preserving the biological diversity of traditional agricultural plant species, but they have tended to ignore a serious component: the knowledge about those crops and methods of farming held by the people who have long raised them. Virginia Nazarea now makes a case for preserving cultural memory along with biodiversity. By exploring how indigenous people farm sweet potatoes in Bukidnon, Philippines, she discovers specific ways in which the conservation of genetic resources and the conservation of culture can support each other. Interweaving a wealth of ecological and cognitive data with oral history, Nazarea details a \"memory banking\" protocol for collecting and conserving cultural information to complement the genetic, agronomic, and biochemical characterization of important crops. She shows that memory banking offers significant benefits for local populations\u00d1not only the preservation of traditional knowledge but also the maintenance of alternatives to large-scale agricultural development and commercialization. She also compares alternative forms of germplasm conservation conducted by a male-dominated hierarchy with those of an informal network of migrant women. Cultural Memory and Biodiversity establishes valuable guidelines for people who aspire to support community-based in situ conservation of local varieties. Perhaps more important, it shows that the traditional methods of local farmers are often as important as the \"advanced\" methods encouraged by advocates of modernization.",

        "description":"\"Like Joan Didion's The Year of Magical Thinking, an extraordinarily moving and engaging look at loss and death. Eve Joseph is an award-winning poet who worked for twenty years as a palliative care counselor in a hospice. When she was a young girl, she lost a much older brother, and her experience as a grown woman helping others face death, dying, and grief opens the path for her to recollect and understand his loss in a way she could not as a child. In the Slender Margin is an insider's look at an experience that awaits us all, and that is at once deeply fascinating, frightening, and in modern society shunned. The book is an intimate invitation to consider death and our response to it without fear or morbidity, but rather with wonder and a curious mind. Writing with a poet's precise language and in short meditative chapters leavened with insight, warmth, and occasional humor, Joseph cites her hospice experience as well as the writings of others across generations--from the realms of mythology, psychology, science, religion, history, and literature--to illuminate the many facets of dying and death. Offering examples from cultural traditions, practices, and beliefs from around the world, her book is at once an exploration of the unknowable and a very humane journey through the land of grief. \"--",

Everything from the types of flowers blooming to the nursery rhymes that children said. It\u2019s all here. From ships to soaps to sealing wax. <br \/><br \/>Apparently Barbara (nee Alderley) was more beautiful than is almost believable. However, if you swallow that, you can pretty much believe the rest of the book\u2014hook, line, and sinker. Wanna know about growing tobacco back then? Check. Shipping bees back then? Check. The royal household quirks back then? Check. The architecture of Christopher Wren? Check.<br \/><br \/>The end felt a little rushed, but after 734 pages, including the epilogue and bonus chapters, well, it\u2019s hard to believe anything could feel rushed.

        "description":"A polished and masterly work of historical narrative, The Marshall Plan is an instant classic of Cold War literature. With Britain's empire collapsing and Stalin's ascendant, U.S. officials under new Secretary of State George C. Marshall set out to reconstruct western Europe as a bulwark against communist authoritarianism. Their massive, costly, and ambitious undertaking would confront Europeans and Americans alike with a vision at odds with their history and self-conceptions. In the process, they would drive the creation of NATO, the European Union, and a Western identity that continues to shape world events. This is the story behind the birth of the Cold War, and the U.S.-led liberal global order, told with verve, insight, and resonance for today. Bringing to bear fascinating new material from American, Russian, German, and other European archives, Benn Steil's book will forever change how we see the Marshall Plan. Focusing on the critical years 1947 to 1949, Steil's gripping narrative takes us through the seminal episodes that marked the collapse of postwar U.S.-Soviet relations: the Prague coup, the Berlin blockade, and the division of Germany. In each case, Stalin's determination to crush the Marshall Plan and undermine American power in Europe is vividly portrayed. And in a riveting epilogue, Steil shows how the forces which clove Europe in two after the Second World War have reasserted themselves since the collapse of the Soviet Union.",

        "description":"With an engaging writing style that has made it a popular choice at both 2 and 4-year schools, the Second Edition of Anna Leon-Guerrero\u2019s Social Problems textbook humanizes social problems and addresses their consequences while emphasizing community awareness and action. The text focuses on inequalities, examining how race and ethnicity, gender, social class, sexual orientation, and age determine our life chances. Each chapter includes a discussion of relevant social policies or programs and highlights how individuals or groups have made a difference in their communities. Although the book looks primarily at the United States, global perspectives are interwoven where appropriate. Pedagogical features and a companion study site provide a platform for discussion that encourages critical thinking about the problems presented. Key Features Retained and New to This Edition Coverage of social inequalities is expanded to five new chapters at the start of the text: New Chapters 2 through 6 (\u201cSocial Class and Poverty,\u201d \u201cRace and Ethnicity,\u201d \u201cGender,\u201d \u201cSexual Orientation,\u201d and \u201cAge and Aging\u201d) focus on the bases of social inequality and how each contributes to our experience and understanding of social problems. Four theoretical perspectives (including feminism) are include throughout. A new full-color page design and larger trim size allow for better displays of visual content. The book features an improved illustration program, including visual essays now introducing each part of the text, and an expanded photo program, with carefully selected images spread throughout the chapters. The text has an increased focus on globalization, including more comparative theoretical material and examples in the \u201cTaking a World View\u201d boxes. \u201cVoices in the Community\u201d features provide personal stories from people attempting to make a difference in their communities. The new \"What Does It Mean To Me?\" features ask students to personalize the problems and solutions under study. The concluding chapter, \u201cSocial Problems and Social Action,\u201d identifies ways in which students can become more involved in helping resolve issues in their own communities. \u201cInternet and Community Exercises\u201d at the end of each chapter include questions or activities that can be completed individually or by small student groups. These exercises take students out of the classroom, away from the textbook, and into their communities!",

From there it takes you on a ride with the delightful MC Keira. It gives you the cozy feeling of being in a small town with a bunch of likable characters. Yet, there is always that bit of mystery and danger lurking. Throughout the book, I fell in love with the town, Keira, and the group of people that she\u2019s surrounded by. And then finding out there is a second book to this really made my heart soar. <br \/><br \/>Overall, this is a great book for those that love a bit of a scare but are not ready to get too dark or creepy.<\/p>",

Landscape of Mothers has the potential to be a map of liberation, for you personally, and for all of us if we do it together. While this is the big vision I have for The Landscape of Mothers, I also know that it all begins with our own internal freedom to choose our legacy. My desired legacy isone of interconnectedness, cherished individuality, and recognizing that our most precious resource is one another. Landscape of Mothers is a map for utilizing our time in motherhood as a pilgrimage to ourselves, of growing alongside our children. It's a journey of the personal, the familial, the ancestral. It's many layers offer us continued insights into who we are and what we want to contribute to the world. What do we want the world to look like, for ourselves and for our children?",

Employing numerous examples, Brian Campbell explores the development of the Roman army and the expansion of the Roman Empire from 31 BC-280 AD.When Augustus established a permanent, professional army, this implied a role for the Emperor as a military leader. Warfare and Society in Imperial Rome examines this personal association between army and emperor, and argues that the Emperor's position as commander remained much the same for the next 200 years.Dealing with issues such as the financial implications of supporting a professional army in war and peace, Brian Campbell explores the wider significance of the army and warfare in Roman life and culture. This superbly researched survey provides students with an invaluable guide to this important and much neglected subject.",

        "description":"Presents an essential guide to the art of talking with children that demonstrates how a change of voice can transform conversations and ease parent-child relationships, sharing strategies for communicating with kids at different age levels.\n\n\"Most parents are perfectly fine communicators--unless they're talking to their children. Then, too often, their pitch rises and they come across as pleading, indignant, wounded, outraged. In tone and body language they signal, 'I can't handle it when you act like a child.' Dr. Wendy Mogel saw this pattern time and again in her clinical practice. In response she developed a remarkably effective series of 'voice lessons,' which she shared with parents who were struggling with their kids. The results were immediate: a shift in vocal style led to children who were calmer, listened more attentively, and communicated with more warmth, respect, and sincerity. In [this book], Mogel elaborates on her novel clinical approach, revealing how each age and stage of a child's life brings new opportunities to connect through language. Drawing from sources as diverse as neuroscience, fairy tales, and anthropology, Mogel offers specific guidance for talking to children across the expanse of childhood and adolescence. She also explains the best ways to talk about your child to partners, exes, and grandparents, as well as to teachers, coaches, and caretakers. Throughout the book, Mogel addresses an obstacle that bedevils even the most seasoned and confident parent: the distraction of digital devices, how they impact our connection with our families, and what we can do about it. Mogel's now classic book, The Blessing of a Skinned Knee, is a beloved resource for a generation of parents. Voice Lessons for Parents brings her unique brand of practical wisdom to harried parents eager to deepen their relationships with their kids. 'Children will lead you on an incredible journey,' writes Mogel, 'if they trust you, if you take the time, and if you're willing to follow.'\"--Dust jacket.",

        "description":"Shortlisted for the FT\/McKinsey Business Book of the Year award A renowned climate scientist shows how fossil fuel companies have waged a thirty-year campaign to deflect blame and responsibility and delay action on climate change, and offers a battle plan for how we can save the planet. Recycle. Fly less. Eat less meat. These are some of the ways that we've been told can slow climate change. But the inordinate emphasis on individual behavior is the result of a marketing campaign that has succeeded in placing the responsibility for fixing climate change squarely on the shoulders of individuals. Fossil fuel companies have followed the example of other industries deflecting blame (think \"guns don't kill people, people kill people\") or greenwashing (think of the beverage industry's \"Crying Indian\" commercials of the 1970s). Meanwhile, they've blocked efforts to regulate or price carbon emissions, run PR campaigns aimed at discrediting viable alternatives, and have abdicated their responsibility in fixing the problem they've created. The result has been disastrous for our planet. In The New Climate War, Mann argues that all is not lost. He draws the battle lines between the people and the polluters-fossil fuel companies, right-wing plutocrats, and petrostates. And he outlines a plan for forcing our governments and corporations to wake up and make real change, including: A common-sense, attainable approach to carbon pricing- and a revision of the well-intentioned but flawed currently proposed version of the Green New Deal; Allowing renewable energy to compete fairly against fossil fuels Debunking the false narratives and arguments that have worked their way into the climate debate and driven a wedge between even those who support climate change solutions Combatting climate doomism and despair-mongering With immensely powerful vested interests aligned in defense of the fossil fuel status quo, the societal tipping point won't happen without the active participation of citizens everywhere aiding in the collective push forward. This book will reach, inform, and enable citizens everywhere to join this battle for our planet.",

The editors and several of the authors write from practical field experience in nonproliferation and counterterrorism efforts. Others have had significant responsibility for developing government policies to address the threat of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism. The contributors include a majority of the significant names in the field including Bruce Hoffman, Brian Jenkins, Jonathan Tucker, Rohan Gunaratna, David Franz, Richard Betts, William Rosenau, and David Albright.\r\nUnit One of the book introduces key terms and addresses important strategic and policy debates. Authors explain how the new forms of terrorism affect the post-9\/11 security environment and introduce the notion that weapons of mass destruction could give terrorists short-term, asymmetric attack advantages over conventional military forces. Unit Two offers detailed accounts of the characteristics, availability, and dangers of specific types of WMD, along with four case studies that associate theory with practice\u2014an important feature of this volume. Unit Three deals with past, present, and future national and international responses to\u2014and defenses against\u2014the threat of WMD terrorism. And in the final section of the volume, authors predict future WMD threats and seek to draw on past events and mistakes in order to identify lessons and strategies for the future.\r\nAppendices include a primer on bioterrorism and fact sheets on chemical, biological, nuclear and radiological terrorism.",

        "description":"I Remember, one of French writer Georges Perec\u2019s most famous pieces, consists of 480 numbered paragraphs\u2014each just a few short lines recalling a memory from his childhood. The work has neither a beginning nor an end. Nor does it contain any analysis. But it nonetheless reveals profound truths about French society during the 1940s and 50s. Taking Perec\u2019s book as its cue, Telling About Society explores the unconventional ways we communicate what we know about society to others. The third in distinguished teacher Howard Becker\u2019s best-selling series of writing guides for social scientists, the book explores the many ways knowledge about society can be shared and interpreted through different forms of telling\u2014fiction, films, photographs, maps, even mathematical models\u2014many of which remain outside the boundaries of conventional social science. Eight case studies, including the photographs of Walker Evans, the plays of George Bernard Shaw, the novels of Jane Austen and Italo Calvino, and the sociology of Erving Goffman, provide convincing support for Becker\u2019s argument: that every way of telling about society is perfect\u2014for some purpose. The trick is, as Becker notes, to discover what purpose is served by doing it this way rather than that. With Becker\u2019s trademark humor and eminently practical advice, Telling About Society is an ideal guide for social scientists in all fields, for artists interested in saying something about society, and for anyone interested in communicating knowledge in unconventional ways.",

Accepting a temporary job with Cade and four blazing hot veterans should have been my way in. Except, Cade acts like he would rather be tortured than speak to me. He can resist all he wants, but I made a promise that I intend to keep. Even if it costs me everything. Cade: I've watched her for over a year. There's something about her that seems familiar... but now that she's living here for two weeks, I could care less what it is. I just want her gone. Breck is temptation personified, and some lines can't be crossed. I'm Major Cade Jameson, and I made a promise, too. One that I can't break. No matter how hard IT gets.",

        "description":"What makes a great law professor? The first study of its kind, What the Best Law Teachers Do identifies the methods, strategies, and personal traits of professors whose students achieve exceptional learning. This pioneering book will be of interest to any instructor seeking concrete, proven techniques for helping students succeed. What the Best Law Teachers Do introduces readers to twenty-six professors from law schools across the United States. These instructors are renowned for their exacting standards: they set expectations high, while also making course requirements--and their belief that their students can meet them--clear from the outset. They demonstrate professional behavior and tell students to approach class as they would their future professional life: by being as prepared, polished, and gracious as possible. And they prepare themselves for class in depth, even when they have taught the course for years. The best law professors understand that the little things matter. They start class on time and stay afterward to answer questions. They learn their students' names and respond promptly to emails. These instructors are all tough--but they are also committed, creative, and compassionate mentors. With its close-to-the-ground accounts of exceptional educators in action, What the Best Law Teachers Do offers insights into effective pedagogy that transcend the boundaries of legal education.",

Unfortunately I'm comparing this to some of the other graphic memoirs of family conflict\/identity and it's not as favorable. Her art is technically fantastic and really striking, but that precision gives it a layer of remove and coldness that is also true in the story. This book seemed to want to be three things at once and none of them were fully realized: an exploration of her own relationship to her parents\/childhood, an exploration of her father's history and what radicalized and ultimately killed him, AND an explanation of former Yugoslovian (Serbian\/Croation specifically) history and conflict through the lens of her family. The sections are disjointed and lose momentum (but gain lots of text) when she takes you outside of her family history to explain the country history. The ending in particular is confusing, it's metaphorical and surreal and I think I understand it but even I'm not entirely sure, so that's going to leave students frustrated. I think there's a place for this in SS classrooms as students are studying world conflicts but be prepared to have some discussion time built in to handle potential student confusion.",

Surprisingly sympathetic (without of course condoning some terrible acts). The art is well-crafted and a also relatively unusual style in the medium \u2013 you see a lot of faux-amateur indie comics; a few photorealistic; plenty that mimic the mainstream. You don\u2019t see a ton with this sort of Wall Street Journal portrait crosshatching\/stippling style. Or, at least, I don\u2019t.<br \/><br \/>I did find it interesting how the author anglicized not just names and nicknames (somewhat reasonable, though I realized I kind of expect at least <em>some<\/em> foreign words thrown into conversation between foreigners in media) but also the conversational style. I had to remind myself that these conversations were (presumably, though never explicitly stated) taking place in Serbo-Croatian. Even a few place names got anglicized: Ni\u0161 became \u201cNish,\u201d for example. But Dejan wasn\u2019t \u201cDeyan.\u201d This won\u2019t be a thing for most people, but as someone who spends a lot of time around Serbs (girlfriend and family), I actually found it kind of distracting.<\/p>",

Must be a miserable way to live. When she actually gets into the science it\u2019s fine but the \u201cI worried about this\u201d and that oh no, lost her mom when she was a grown woman and acts like it was the end of the world, I knew not to expect too much.

I read along, enjoying, thinking. \u201cOkay, what bonkers thing is going to happen next,\u201d and then another bonkers thing would happen. I found it very VC Andrews Flowers in the Attic in tone, a bit more soap operaesque, meant to be engaging, but not literary or deep. <br \/><br \/>Mercy, the main character, is pretty simple in doing what it takes to survive. There are no scenes where she thinks or analyzes. The writing heavily favors telling over showing. I think the story would have had a whole different tone and a different level of engagement for me if Mercy would have been more proactive, instead of waiting for the bad thing to happen before making her next move. <br \/><br \/>The last portion of the book, however, seemed deeper, started to make me care and engage more, as the book felt like it had a theme, a message, and Mercy seemed to experience growth. One of the things I would say about the series that began with Flowers in the Attic is that Cathy never really matured from the child she was in the very beginning, never really operated as an adult. Mercy was similar for most of the book, and then she took steps to become more. <br \/><br \/>And so toward the end, I though, okay, it\u2019s about sisterhood, not just the biological kind, but the female relationships we choose for ourselves \u2013 wow, I like that. But everything that came before only lightly hinted at that. If this book at been operating at this level, both in terms of the sisterhood angle and in terms of feminist commentary on the men she encounters \u2013 whew! <br \/><br \/>4 stars because I always liked this book, and it would be 4 stars even if that last portion didn\u2019t become more layered, because it was entertaining. I LOVED Flowers in the Attic, after all. However, that last portion indicates to me that Jenna Cosgrove has more going on than I thought, and that it\u2019s quite likely I will love future books from her. <br \/><br \/>Also, love tattoos, so\u2026<\/p>",

                "comment":"<p>This was such a fun and juicy read. It felt like a combination of reality TV shows like Selling Sunset and mystery books like Big Little Lies. <br \/><br \/>The story is centered around Jenny, a successful salon owner, and 4 of her very rich clients. I liked that all of the characters brought something a little different to the table. Ruthless Olivia, lost Shannon, na\u00efve Crystal, pragmatic Kate and peacekeeper Jenny. Not to say they\u2019re one dimensional characters. In fact, throughout the book we see different sides of each of them. <br \/><br \/>The main focus of the story is the relationship between these characters rather than the mystery. And the relationships, with years of secrets and resentments, is filled with cattiness, snark, and figurative backstabbing. A lot of times it really reminded me of watching reality TV. <br \/><br \/>For most of the book the only thing we know is that one of them is dead, but all the way to the reveal, the book had me guessing on who was gonna be murdered and by whom. <br \/><br \/>If you enjoy flawed characters, this books has plenty. I liked they all got their own POV, so we could see what their motivations were from their own perspective. Since not all of them are likeable, (there was one I especially loved to hate) seeing their side of things helped. <br \/><br \/>This book does a great job of keeping the drama intriguing and engaging. I honestly don\u2019t know if it was the drama or the mystery that kept me turning the pages more but I was HOOKED.<br \/><br \/>I loved the ending!<\/p>",

        "description":"No drinking.No smoking.No cursing.No dancing.No R-rated movies.Kevin Roose wasn't used to rules like these. As a sophomore at Brown   University , he spent his days drinking fair-trade coffee, singing in an a cappella group, and fitting right in with Brown's free-spirited, ultra-liberal student body. But when Roose leaves his Ivy League confines to spend a semester at Liberty   University, a conservative Baptist school in Lynchburg , Virginia  , obedience is no longer optional.Liberty  is the late Reverend Jerry Falwell's \"Bible Boot Camp\" for young evangelicals, his training ground for the next generation of America 's Religious Right. Liberty  's ten thousand undergraduates take courses like Evangelism 101, hear from guest speakers like Sean Hannity and Karl Rove, and follow a forty-six-page code of conduct that regulates every aspect of their social lives. Hoping to connect with his evangelical peers, Roose decides to enroll at Liberty  as a new transfer student, leaping across the God Divide and chronicling his adventures in this daring report from the front lines of America 's culture war.His journey takes him from an evangelical hip-hop concert to choir practice at Falwell's legendary Thomas   Road   Baptist   Church . He experiments with prayer, participates in a spring break mission trip to Daytona Beach  (where he learns to preach the gospel to partying coeds), and pays a visit to Every Man's Battle  , an on-campus support group for chronic masturbators. He meets pastors' kids, closet doubters, Christian rebels, and conducts what would be the last print interview of Rev. Falwell's life. Hilarious and heartwarming, respectful and thought-provoking, THE UNLIKELY DISCIPLE will inspire and entertain believers and nonbelievers alike.  Ebook exclusive: Bonus quiz",

                "comment":"<p>I\u2019ll be honest: I\u2019m downright angry about this book. My anger started around page 38 and never abated. You see, Seanan McGuire values representation. She does not apparently value <i>correctly<\/i> representing people. When the protagonist complained that she had not developed breasts and was short, I assumed we were getting some Turner Syndrome representation \u2013 you know, a syndrome, that results in delayed puberty and short stature. When instead, McGuire declared her protagonist to have CAIS (complete androgen insensitivity) I was confused. It had been a while since I\u2019d taken my general genetics boards but it took me only 30 seconds on google to confirm: girls with CAIS have normal breast development and normal height velocity with a normal age of maximum height velocity (growth spurt). I kept reading \u2013 maybe the protagonist had a secret gonadectomy to explain those features? Maybe the mother was confused? But no explanation was forthcoming and it dawned on me: I don\u2019t think McGuire actually ever spoke to anyone with CAIS. And the more I thought about that, the more it upset me: McGuire refers to Regan multiple times as being \u201cintersex,\u201d a term that many women in the CAIS community don\u2019t use to refer to themselves. I had originally felt okay with Regan reclaiming the term, but the more I thought about McGuire using it with apparently no community input the less good I felt about it. And I thought about how McGuire portrays herself as a champion of diversity and the harm caused by tokenism rather than true representation. This is not doing it right. Do better. Talk to people with disorders of sexual development and ask how they\u2019d like to be portrayed. At the very least, do a five minute google search. (Failing all of that, I once again offer my services as a professional geneticist who will fact-check speculative fiction for the low cost of a free book.)<br \/><br \/>(I have other feelings about the book, but this really is the most important one.)<\/p>",

                "comment":"<p>Seanan McGuire, the author of Across the Green Grass Fields, the newest addition to the Wayward Children series, is bringing us a touching and verdant tale that takes place amongst centaurs and unicorns.<br \/><br \/>Seanan McGuire, author of countless novels, novellas, comics, short stories, and songs, has an inborn connection to myths and legends. In reading her stories, it seems like McGuire takes tales of old and twists them, turns them on their head, and serves them to her readers like an exquisite delicacy. I have gorged myself on her stories in the past. I can say that I have enjoyed what Seanan has written for her full catalog in one way or another. Even the stories that don\u2019t 100% connect with me as a reader, I appreciate her mastery as a writer. Luckily for me, she is a prolific writer, and I have many choices in stories. <br \/><br \/>All that being said, I enjoyed Across the Green Grass Fields, as I have enjoyed or loved the other books in her Wayward Children series, but this one was not my favorite. I came out of the story almost ambivalent to the plot. <br \/><br \/>The story starts with the main character, a little girl named Regan. Regan is different than other girls in the story. You see how Regan is kind and empathetic and how she stumbles in personal relationships as McGuire details the intricacies of those relationships with her peers. Girls can be mean, the mean girl stereotype is there for a reason, and she is getting the full force of it due to her \u201cbest friend.\u201d  While Regan is ten at the start of this story, that is only in years as Regan is far wiser in some ways than your average ten-year-old girl. Regan has one passion, and that is a love of horses. According to Regan, this is an acceptable passion for a young girl. Had she had a passion, for say, bugs, she knows that she would be ostracized and shunned as some of her classmates had been. She keeps most of this love to herself and does not share it with her schoolmates. This self-awareness plays a significant role in Regan\u2019s character\u2019s development as the story moves onwards. <br \/><br \/>As the story continues, Regan ages, and her schoolmates physically develop. But, Regan seems stalled in her childlike stage. She is standing on the precipice of starting that terrible transition to adulthood but not quite getting there. <br \/><br \/>She goes to her parents with the question, \u201cWhy?\u201d Why is she different than the other girls? Her parents let her know that she is intersex. I am delighted that McGuire took such a real and pertinent issue and gave it the treatment it deserves. Regan is an example of one of McGuire\u2019s strengths, in that she treats and creates children as real human beings. They feel fear, panic, and emotional turmoil and are not treated with, pardon the pun, kid gloves. <br \/><br \/>Regan reaches out to a \u201cfriend\u201d and explains to her friend what being intersex is. She wants to talk about a momentous thing in her life so she reaches out to a \u201cfriend.\u201d The \u201cfriend\u201d reacts as I can imagine some children reacting and starts yelling at her, calling her a boy and telling the school. What should be an intimate moment between friends turns into taunting and jeers from uninformed and cruel kids. Regan runs out of her school. <br \/><br \/>At this point, Regan finds a door. <br \/><br \/>If you are familiar with any of the Wayward Children books, you understand the significance of a door and what it means for the child. The door is to a place, unlike your home. In previous books, a door led children to a land of mad science and death, a goblin market, or lands made of candy. Each land changes the child. In this child\u2019s case, the land that Regan walked into is one called Hooflands. A land of centaurs, unicorns, and other creatures of the same ilk. Perfect land for one who loves all creatures equine. It is said when a human child comes through a door into the Hooflands; it portends to change. By the act of her coming to The Hooflands, her human nature wills a destiny into effect. One that will affect the citizens of The Hooflands and change the world they know. Regan does not believe in destiny. <br \/><br \/>\u201cWelcome to the Hooflands. We\u2019re happy to have you, even if you being here means something\u2019s coming.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The second and third part of Across the Grass Green Fields details the land of centaurs and unicorns. It is an unusual lake on the mythos behind these creatures. McGuire\u2019s Worldbuilding is lush and verdant. Like any of her other stories across multiple genres, there is always a slightly dark edge to everything. What may be green and gorgeous with towering trees and emerald green moss will likely be housing monsters. This speaks to McGuire\u2019s familiarity with folk tales and legends. Before Disney, stories such as The Little Mermaid and Hansel and Gretel were tales of fancy as much as cautionary. Good does not always conquer evil. Sometimes the witch does eat the children, and the mermaid might not get the prince. And, of course, everything has teeth. <br \/><br \/>Regan spends years living amongst the creatures of The Hooflands. She becomes a wild girl, probably who she was always meant to be. She also learns self-reliance, kindness, strength of will, and character. I like who Regan becomes; it feels like a proper extension and growth for her as a character. But, as a human is an omen for significant change in the Hooflands, Regan has a destiny that will be fulfilled. Even if she doesn\u2019t believe in fate and wants to be left alone with her found family.<br \/><br \/>\u201cShe still didn\u2019t believe in destiny. Clay shaped into a cup was not always destined to become a drinking vessel\u2019 it was simply shaped by someone too large to be resisted. She was not clay, but she had been shaped by her circumstances all the same, not directed by any destiny.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The fourth and final act of the story is where Across the Green Grass Fields lost me a little bit. This book has beautiful writing, a great explanation of centaurs\u2019 matriarchal society, and touching descriptions of the real friendships Regan makes. But, beyond the lush details, the actual plot and final crescendo of the story fell flat for me. It felt anti-climatic in the face of such excellent writing. However, I have to say that Regan\u2019s very practical nature is entertaining to read. The vital thing to note about the ending, even though I found it anti-climatic; it is in line with Regan\u2019s character. One of the major themes of Across the Green Grass Fields has to do with destiny or lack thereof. Regan believes in her future, her own path. It will not be defined by what and who thinks it should. That idea starts slow when dealing with her peers\u2019 preconceived notions and eventually crescendos at the end of the story.  Regan becomes more comfortable in her shoes and does not care if that bothers anyone. <br \/><br \/>Overall, I enjoyed this addition to The Wayward Children series, great characters, and a lush world.  It is solid, but I think it lacks the same oomph that other books in the series have. I will continue reading the Wayward Books, taken as a whole series; they are lovely and some of McGuires best writing.<\/p>",

                "comment":"<p>This is a deeply meaningful, beautifully written book. It is a complete story that stands alone. Everyone should read it.<br \/><br \/>Written in the form of a rather poetic children\u2019s book, this is on one level, the story of a child who finds a door in the a forest and steps through to another world. On another level this is a story of what identity means, and the fundamental wrongness of labeling people, dictating expected behaviour by those labels and how society inherently punishes those who do not fit expectations.  <br \/><br \/>Again, this is a beautifully written fable for today.

                "comment":"This review is also featured on Behind the Pages: Across the Green Grass Fields\n\nLike all the Wayward Children, Regan\u2019s door appears when she wants nothing more than to have a world where she is accepted for who she is. Unknowingly she enters and finds herself in the Hooflands. A world where equine creatures such as centaurs and unicorns are its inhabitants. With her love for horses, Regan feels at home as she settles in with a family of centaur herders. But all humans who enter the Hooflands are pulled by destiny to save it. And dark secrets are lurking in the land.\n\nAcross the Green Grass Fields is not as dark as previous Wayward Children books. But that doesn\u2019t mean the story isn\u2019t as good. The central theme of the series remains the same. Children find doors to other worlds when they feel they are no longer accepted in our world. What may throw a few readers is the brand new character, Regan, who is introduced. This one is set as a standalone novel, so none of the characters readers have come to know throughout the series will be present.\n\nSeanan McGuire always tackles unique subjects in the Wayward Children series. This time Regan is put out by her friends after sharing a secret about herself. (To avoid spoilers, you\u2019ll have to read the book to find out what exactly that secret is.) And unfortunately, because Regan is different from the other girls, once this secret has been told, the whispers and mean gossip begins. Feeling ostracized she leaves school. And so the door to the Hooflands appears, allowing her into a world that will accept Regan for who she is despite her differences.\n\nEach new story in the Wayward Children is as heartbreaking as it is captivating. The depth of imagination that goes into each new world is surprisingly detailed given the length of each book. This is one series I don\u2019t want to see come to an end. There are so many possibilities, so many different worlds that can be discovered. If you\u2019re looking for a quick read and enjoy fantasy, give this series a try.",

Walking home from school after a rough day of bad choices, she finds a strange door and stumbles into another world, a world populated by various equine races. Her presence means their world needs saving, but Regan doesn\u2019t believe in destiny, and doesn\u2019t want to be a hero.<br \/><br \/>This is the 6th book in the Wayward Children series, but is a complete standalone novella. Regan has not been in any of the other books and the story is completely self-contained.<br \/><br \/>I loved Regan as a character and enjoyed seeing her start to question the world and her place in it. I thought the Hooflands were wonderful, with a well developed culture between the various hooved races (which includes centaurs, kelpies, satyrs and more).<br \/><br \/>While I\u2019d have liked a longer epilogue showing some of the fallout of Regan\u2019s adventure I understand why McGuire ended this novella where she did. It wraps up this particular story nicely, though I\u2019m hopeful there\u2019s a follow-up novella that continues Regan\u2019s story.<br \/><br \/>The copy of the book I reviewed was an advance reader copy, so it didn\u2019t have the illustrations by Rovina Cai. I\u2019ve seen a few of them on the Tor.com website (www.tor.com\/2020\/11\/17\/rovina-cai-illustrates-across-the-green-grass-fields-by-seanan-mcguire\/) and they\u2019re quite nice and I can imagine they help add to the fairytale quality of the story.<br \/><br \/>If you love horses and character development, this one\u2019s for you.<\/p>",

Maybe that was why the shape in the nearby growth caught her eye, and she stopped abruptly, sending a pebble clattering into the creek as she cocked her head and blinked at what was surely a trick of the light.<br \/><br \/>Two trees had grown around each other, branches tangling and twisting like the wicker of a basket. They looped in and out of one another\u2019s embrace, until they formed what looked almost like a doorway. That was interesting, but not unique; branches often grew together, and the shapes they made in the process could be remarkably architectural. She\u2019d seen castles in the trees when she was little, castles and dragons and all manner of fabulous things.<br \/><br \/>But she\u2019d never seen a doorway before.&lt;\/blockquote&gt;<br \/><br \/>WHAT\u2019S <i>ACROSS THE GREEN GRASS FIELDS<\/i> ABOUT? <br \/>Regan is ten-years-old when she finds this doorway, but we meet her when she\u2019s a little younger. We see her making regrettable, entirely predictable (and understandable) mistakes when it comes to friendship, the kind of mistakes that shape her social future in ways she can\u2019t imagine. We readers cringe, hope she\u2019d make better choices, and then just wait to see how bad the damage is going to be when she realizes (probably too late) that she\u2019s befriended and trusted the wrong sort of person. Other than that mistake, she seems like a sweet girl, she loves horses and riding, her family, and her friend.<br \/><br \/>The day after she learns something devastating from her parents, she learns that lesson about trust the hard way and runs away from school into the less-developed area between her school and home.<br \/><br \/>As children do in this series, she walks through that doorway and finds herself in a new world. The first person she meets (a centaur) tells her it\u2019s called The Hoooflands. And she is <i>excited<\/i> to find a human. Humans arrive in The Hooflands when something is about to happen\u2014when something that is plaguing their society will be confronted and defeated by the human (who have thumbs and can fit in places a centaur can\u2019t, so there are two big advantages for the human).<br \/><br \/>But first, the centaur takes Regan to meet her family. And then years pass. She matures, she sees the errors she made in trusting the wrong people on Earth. She picks up skills, she learns who she is. Yes, she misses her family, but this is home to her and she\u2019s content.<br \/><br \/>THE HOOFLANDS <br \/>&lt;blockquote&gt;\u2026and there were people. Centaurs like the ones Regan knew. More delicate centaurs with the lower bodies of graceful deer and the spreading antlers to match. Satyrs and fauns and minotaurs and bipeds with human torsos but equine legs and haunches, like centaurs that had been clipped nearly in half. It was a wider variety of hooved humanity that Regan could have imagined.&lt;\/blockquote&gt;<br \/>On the one hand, I really like this world\u2014of all the worlds on other sides of doors that we\u2019ve visited in this series, it seems more viable than any of them (except maybe for maybe The Goblin Market), it takes a little less suspension of disbelief to see how the world works (once you accept the population, anyway).<br \/><br \/>At the same time\u2026there\u2019s something about this society that I don\u2019t understand how it functions at all given the way that other species see each other. Obviously, this is a not-at-all-thinly-veiled metaphor for our society, but even metaphors should have some sort of air of believability. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but every time that came up, it took me out of the story for a bit, because I couldn\u2019t understand how the world functions (set aside justice and morality, I\u2019m talking just in terms of practicality). It\u2019d take too long to flesh this out, so I won\u2019t. But it bugged me.<br \/><br \/>The individual people we spend time with in The Hooflands? Loved \u2018em.  They\u2019re the best characters we\u2019ve met in this series that weren\u2019t connected to the School. I resented how much time McGuire let pass between chapters because I wanted to spend more time with them and to understand the Centaur culture a bit more.<br \/><br \/>SO, WHAT DID I THINK ABOUT <i>ACROSS THE GREEN GRASS FIELDS<\/i>? <br \/>&lt;blockquote&gt;It had been more than five years since Regan ran away from school on purpose and ran away from home by mistake.&lt;\/blockquote&gt;<br \/>So begins the endgame for this particular novella, Regan heads off to meet the Queen and do what she was brought to the Hooflands to do once and for all, and then (she assumes) to get her door back home. She doesn\u2019t really want to leave the Hooflands, but circumstances are forcing her hand.<br \/><br \/>This is the crux of probably my biggest problem with the book\u2014she\u2019s spent five years telling anyone who\u2019ll listen (primarily herself) that she doesn\u2019t believe in Destiny, she won\u2019t bend to Destiny. But in the end, that\u2019s exactly what she does. I\u2019m not going to get into a debate about determinism here, but Regan would be a great Exhibit A for my case if I wanted to.<br \/><br \/>This is not a subtle book, McGuire has things she wants to say about destiny, about the choices that others make on behalf of others that are just as binding as the choices they make themselves. And she goes about it in a blatant, almost <b>ABC After School Special<\/b>* manner. And this series is better than that. Or it usually is.<br \/><br \/><i>* Readers of a certain age might want to consult with a parent to fully understand that reference<\/i><br \/><br \/>I liked <b>Across the Green Grass Fields<\/b>, but this is not up to either McGuire\u2019s standard or the standard of <b>The Wayward Children<\/b> series, and it was far enough short of those high marks that I\u2019m having trouble generating much enthusiasm for it. The language, the storytelling style, the imaginative world were there. But they were overshadowed too frequently for my taste by the rest.<br \/><br \/>I was disappointed. Hopefully, you\u2019re not, or if you were, it doesn\u2019t put you off from trying the rest of this really wonderful series.<br \/><br \/>I fully expect (and hope) to see Regan at Eleanor West\u2019s School for Wayward Children in the future and look forward to seeing what happens after she makes her way back home (even if I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll go well for her long-term). I\u2019ll be back for the 2022 novella in this series, eager for what McGuire has in store, confident it won\u2019t be like this.<\/p>",

Other seasons in the wilderness become the occasions when God imparts divine understanding, revelation, and richness to believers. In the wilderness is where the believer comes under God's sheltering wings and draws from His endless provisions. By learning to trust the Lord, even in the dry, empty, desolate places of life, a foundation is built. And it is in the wilderness that God's wondrous beauty and glory are discerned. This is a time in which true meaning and purpose for individual existence is found and explored. Life in the Wilderness teaches a believer at any level how to follow God, live a fulfilled life, and enter his or her Promised Land strengthened in the power of God. The author, Charles Haun, attempts to show God Himself as fully as human limitations allow. He also seeks to present as complete a picture of the \"wilderness\" as possible. Life in the Wilderness covers eleven wildernesses in the experiences of the children of Israel, bringing to life the spiritual purpose and meanings of the wilderness seasons in the life of a believer.",

                "comment":"<p>I just finished Tell Me Who You are by Louisa Luna audiobook - Narrators Megan Tusing; Robb Moreira; Stephanie N\u00e9meth-Parker and here are my thoughts. <br \/><br \/>Dr Caroline Strange is a psychiatrist. She always knows what is best for her patients but when a new patient shows up and says he is going to starve someone to death, then leaves before the session is over. Normally these things are just talk but it seems he may well have done what he set out to do when a journalist goes missing, a woman who wrote a piece about Caroline and she lost patients, and the police finds all the signs to Caroline having done it. <br \/><br \/>Caroline knows she didn\u2019t do it so takes matters into her own hands to find the man who came to her and the person he wants dead.<br \/><br \/><br \/>THIS BOOK HAD ME IN KNOTS!!!! Narrators\u2026 You did a fabbo job of keeping the creep factor going throughout the whole book. Enjoy unreliable narrators? UGH this book will keep you just hopping! <br \/><br \/>You get Caroline\u2019s POV, Ellen\u2019s as she is captive and Gordon, who\u2019s POV comes from Carolines past. You may wonder what they all have in common and it does get explained very well at the end. <br \/><br \/>It is a fast paced train wreck of a story. If you like your psychological thrillers to be tight and controlled\u2026.  Well this one will have you in a tizz. I love books like this. You never know what the next page is going to bring and I bloody loved it. <br \/><br \/>You have to give it a shot. Never knowing what to expect was the best part of this book! Excellent writing, well build atmosphere and the characters were terrible people but you can\u2019t help watching them all come undone. <br \/><br \/>5 stars. Best thriller I\u2019ve read this year.<br \/><br \/>Thank you @netgalley and @macmillianaudio  for my gifted ALC<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>",

                "comment":"<p>A four-episode story featuring Donna travelling in time and space and facing typical <i>Doctor Who<\/i> problems\u2026 but without the Doctor being present.<br \/><br \/><b>Out of This World<\/b> \u2013 The first episode sees Donna trying to get over the traumatic events of <i>Silence in the Library<\/i> by spending time at home away from the Doctor. Sylvia\u2019s attempts to fix a problem she doesn\u2019t really understand coincidentally draw Donna\u2019s attention to an Earthbound mystery that seems to have alien involvement. And it\u2019s from there that we kick off the arc that forms the basis of this collection. Despite ending on a minor cliffhanger, it feels comparatively standalone, as if it were the pilot episode for something bigger, setting up a concept without necessarily being part of anything bigger. (Rather like <i>Rose<\/i>, perhaps).<br \/><br \/>The result is nonetheless a decent story, full of misunderstandings and seeing Donna placed in real peril towards the end. Sylvia is good in it, and there\u2019s some great chemistry and banter between Donna and her old schoolfriend Natalie, who becomes the other major character in this mini-series \u2013 the \u201ccompanion\u201d to Donna\u2019s \u201cDoctor\u201d. Donna\u2019s late father also gets a mention, adding depth to Sylvia in particular, which is a nice touch. It\u2019s not spectacular, but it\u2019s a good start and shows that Donna has the strength to take centre stage without the Doctor being present. 4.5 stars. <br \/><br \/><b>Spinvasion<\/b> \u2013 Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t feel that the same could be said for this second episode. It\u2019s a comedy, and these are often hit-and-miss in <i>Doctor Who<\/i>. A lot probably depends on your sense of humour and I can\u2019t say that this suited mine. The cliffhanger from the previous episode is dealt with perfunctorily and then we\u2019re off to an alien planet where everyone is astoundingly stupid. Yes, it\u2019s supposed to be a satire on PR, but it\u2019s clumsily done, with cartoon characters and no real sense of peril \u2013 despite the fact that there\u2019s clearly intended to be.<br \/><br \/>One of the strengths of Donna (and Tate) on TV was her ability to be both mouthy and emotionally vulnerable, caring about the terrible things she was sometimes seeing, and drawing the audience in with her and making the fantastic seem real. There\u2019s no sign of that here, just broad comedy based around people being thick, and Donna shrugging off the massive death toll that the story eventually includes (although largely off-screen). Natalie also seems to be taking to the strangeness far too easily and the whole thing just doesn\u2019t feel at all believable. Which, at least for me, made the comedy fall flat. 2 stars.<br \/><br \/><b>The Sorcerer of Albion<\/b> \u2013 It\u2019s something of a convention in Big Finish collections like this one that one of the four stories has to be set in the past. This time around, that\u2019s medieval England as Donna is mistaken for Merlin (per the classic episode <i>Battlefield<\/i> this is apparently the Doctor, which is why nobody is surprised \u2018Merlin\u2019 has seemingly regenerated into a woman). It\u2019s a considerable improvement over the previous episode, avoiding most of its pitfalls. For a start, it\u2019s a good deal funnier, despite not obviously being a comedy \u2013 instead it has plenty of great one-liners, many of them at Donna\u2019s expense.<br \/><br \/>It also does a better job with Natalie. Indeed, she\u2019s really the main character in this one, with Donna being side-lined for a chunk of it, forcing her reluctant companion to struggle on her own. This makes use of what was established about her in the first episode and shows a more plausible reaction to being unexpectedly thrown through time and space. There are some quite inventive ideas in here too, albeit largely in what would be the visuals were this a different medium. 4 stars.<br \/><br \/><b>The Chiswick Cuckoos<\/b> \u2013 The final episode returns to the present day to wrap up the loose threads from the first one. The focus is naturally back on Donna, although there are some good scenes with Natalie, showing her as the sort of character that would make a good companion but would never voluntarily chose such a life. Sylvia is back again, too, if not quite so prominently as in the first episode, and there are a couple of guest appearances from other recurring characters. <br \/><br \/>Here, it\u2019s up to Donna to save the Doctor, with the latter out of the picture and the result is a good piece of action-oriented fun. As in the previous episode, Donna is very much on form and there is some reflection on her relationship with her mother in between the action on alien spaceships and so on. Of all the episodes in this collection, this is also the most female-led, with the only male characters either unimportant or in the background for most of the story. (Which not only feels right, but goes to show that you can have an all-female \u201cDoctor\u201d\/companion pairing without everyone assuming there\u2019s a lesbian romance going on.) 4 stars.<br \/><\/p>",

No esta claro cual es su contenido minimo, que puede hacer para consolidar nuestras incipientes democracias o por que seria util para disminuir nuestros indices de violencia cotidiana. En ese nivel basico nos encontramos, es decir, en el de tener que explicar, y repetir sin tregua, cosas que en otros lugares podrian parecer obvias.Y hacerlo en los momentos presentes es muy importante, sobre todo si se atiende al uso retorico que con frecuencia hacen nuestros gobernantes de temas como el que nos ocupa (Raz se refiere al \u201cuso promiscuo\u201d del concepto de Estado de derecho). La capacidad legitimadora que tienen conceptos como el de democracia, constitucionalismo, igualdad, imperio de la ley o Estado de derecho es con frecuencia manipulada por gobiernos y gobernantes cuya actuacion mas bien se cifra en la conculcacion de todos ellos, antes que en su respeto. Es importante, por ello, aportar elementos analiticos que sirvan para desarmar la retorica que, buscando legitimacion por via de los puros discursos, termina haciendo naufragar cualquier idea que pudiera servir para alcanzar mejores condiciones de vida en nuestras fragiles democracias.",

        "description":"In this book, probably for the first time in Western philosophy, an attempt has been made to point out and systematically explicate the problem scope of the Nothing (which is called Nihil in the book) and to try to explain the springhead of the excessive negativity, inherent only in the human being, or in other words, the springhead of the human's natural nihilism. Nihilism is treated here not as a posture, pose, or an ideological attitude, but as the spread of the human metaphysical nucleus, of Nihil. Nihilistic annihilation, manifesting itself as the road of the naming of Nihil and of the production of thingly crystals (artificial world) as a result of that naming, usually is called \u201chistory\u201d. Names of Nihil (language phenomena), being the antithesis of Nihil, falsify and cover up Nihil itself, turning it into \u201csupreme\u201d being, e.g. into \u201cthe One\u201d, \u201cGod\u201d, \u201cSubstance\u201d, \u201cMatter\u201d, \u201cSpirit\u201d,ad infinitum. This book should be interesting not only to philosophers or humanitarians, but also to all those who concern themselves with the total human condition.",

She knows he will want the loveliest girl: her sister. She vows she will not let her be next. And so she is taken in her sister's place, and she believes death will soon follow. Lo-Melkhiin's court is a dangerous palace filled with pretty things: intricate statues with wretched eyes, exquisite threads to weave the most beautiful garments. She sees everything as if for the last time.But the first sun rises and sets, and she is not dead. Night after night, Lo-Melkhiin comes to her and listens to the stories she tells, and day after day she is awoken by the sunrise. Exploring the palace, she begins to unlock years of fear that have tormented and silenced a kingdom. Lo-Melkhiin was not always a cruel ruler. Something went wrong. Far away, in their village, her sister is mourning. Through her pain, she calls upon the desert winds, conjuring a subtle unseen magic, and something besides death stirs the air. Back at the palace, the words she speaks to Lo-Melkhiin every night are given a strange life of their own. Little things, at first: a dress from home, a vision of her sister. With each tale she spins, her power grows. Soon she dreams of bigger, more terrible magic: power enough to save a king, if she can put an end to the rule of a monster.",

This, however, is different. It is beautiful and gorgeous and makes one wonder what it would have been like, being the wife of Lo-Melkhin for a night (or more). I only wish that our main heroine had more character development. It seemed to be that she was this static character that didn\u2019t change much, ambition wise. However, this is not that important because the storytelling was that good. I can only hope for more books like this. This is true literature and it was quite a joy to read. Also, the blurb that is given with this book lies a bit. She doesn\u2019t really fall in love with the monster at all. Doesn\u2019t even come close to it.<\/p>",

Su lectura para m\u00ed fue extremadamente tediosa, siendo la lectora vaga que soy, amante de los di\u00e1logos, leer p\u00e1rrafo tras p\u00e1rrafo largo, fue agotador.<br \/><br \/>Es triste porque es una historia interesante, solo que la manera estructurada en la que esta, me dejo insatisfecha. <br \/><br \/>Tengo la idea que si el libro hubiera sido narrado m\u00e1s por Lo-Melkiin, habr\u00eda resultado m\u00e1s interesante. Porque nuestra narradora, de la cual nunca conocemos el nombre, no despert\u00f3 gran curiosidad en m\u00ed. <br \/><br \/>Y, s\u00ed, nunca se llega a saber el nombre de la narradora. Y tampoco de casi ning\u00fan otro personaje, lo cual es sumamente confuso, se refer\u00eda a algunos como \u201cLa Madre de Madre\u201d o algo as\u00ed.

Me dejo con la boca abierta, literalmente. No voy a arruinarte el final, obviamente.<br \/><br \/>A Thousand Nights es un libro complicado de cogerle ritmo, no le\u00ed todav\u00eda el otro libro con el que comparan intensamente a este, as\u00ed que no puedo decirte cual prefiero de los dos, pero no creo que sea el tipo de libro que salte a recomendar a todos. <br \/><br \/><b>Twitter || Blog || Pinterest || Tumblr || Instagram || Facebook<\/b><\/p>",

Very few things actually happened throughout the book, and when they did it felt like they were rushed. Most of this book took place with our main character sitting around being bored, missing her family, and trying to find things to occupy her time. This boredom definitely translated to my own feelings. Another thing,  A Thousand Nights is a fantasy, so you expect a battle scene. What I didn\u2019t expect was that the battle scene would take place 90% of the way through, and only last ONE CHAPTER. The big fantasy battle scene lasted ONE CHAPTER. Talk about disappointment and feeling rushed. It didn\u2019t even feel like a battle, and was extremely anticlimactic. The premise was great, but the execution was definitely lacking and came across as rather rushed and boring.<\/p>",

Linda Morabito Meyer weaves three journeys through this candid account of her life.

One journey is through time to solve the greatest mystery a human being could ever have in her life; and the final journey is to God.

                "comment":"<p>Another good reading experience from Mr. Barzak.  I enjoy his stories of the living interacting with the dead very much.  This novel involving the destruction of a town by a cluster of tornadoes, as told through the post-cataclysmic experiences of the young female protagonist, was apparently intended for a young adult audience but that doesn\u2019t preclude a more mature reader from enjoying it.  There isn\u2019t a lot of depth to the ideas presented here; it\u2019s straight plot with little character development beyond the protagonist, and not much exploration of the idea behind how a sudden death might leave someone stranded on this side of the veil.  I started and finished the book during the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, so that was what the times called for, an enjoyable and well-written easy read.<\/p>",

        "description":"An epic adventure: from the Vikings to the Enlightenment, from barbaric outpost to global hub, this book tells the dazzling history of northern Europe's transformation by sea. 'Pye writes like a dream. Magnificent' Jerry Brotton, author of A History of the World in Twelve Maps ______________ This is a story of saints and spies, of anglers and pirates, traders and marauders - and of how their wild and daring journeys across the North Sea built the world we know. When the Roman Empire retreated, northern Europe was a barbarian outpost at the very edge of everything. A thousand years later, it was the heart of global empires and the home of science, art, enlightenment and money. We owe this transformation to the tides and storms of the North Sea. Boats carried food and raw materials, but also new ideas and information. The seafarers raided, ruined and killed, but they also settled and coupled. With them they brought new tastes and technologies - books, science, clothes, paintings and machines. Drawing on an astonishing breadth of learning and packed with human stories and revelations, this is the epic drama of how we came to be who we are. ______________ 'A closely-researched and fascinating characterisation of the richness of life and the underestimated interconnections of the peoples all around the medieval and early modern North Sea' Chris Wickham, author of The Inheritance of Rome: A History of Europe from 400 to 1000 'Elegant writing and extraordinary scholarship . . . Miraculous' Hugh Aldersey-Williams, author of Periodic Tales and Anatomies 'Bristling, wide-ranged and big-themed . . . at its most meaningful, history involves a good deal of art and storytelling. Pye's book is full of both' Russell Shorto, New York Times 'For anyone, like this reviewer, who is tired of medieval history as a chronicle of kings and kingdoms, knights and ladies, monks and heretics, The Edge of the World provides a welcome respite' Prof Patrick J Geary, Wall Street Journal",

Danny\u2019s life is falling apart. His eleven-year-old son, Will, hasn\u2019t spoken since the death of his mother in a car crash a year earlier, and Danny has just been fired from his construction job. He\u2019s behind on the rent and his nasty landlord is threatening to break his legs if he doesn\u2019t pay soon. Danny needs money, and fast. After observing street performers in a local park, Danny spends his last few dollars on a tattered panda costume, impulsively deciding to become a dancing bear. While performing one day, Danny spots his son being taunted by a group of older boys. Danny chases them off, and Will opens up for the first time since his mom died, unaware that the man in the panda costume is his father. Afraid of disclosing his true identity, Danny comforts his son. But will Danny lose Will\u2019s trust once he reveals who he is? And will he be able to dance his way out of despair? Filled with a delightful cast of characters, Bear Necessity is \u201ca moving, sensitive story that is also very funny, and a perfect literary antidote to anxious, troubled times\u201d (Shelf Awareness).",

When Lily and her two Sisters, Alice and Cara, are called out to their latest assignment, she figures it's just another run-of-the-mill gig: spot the Vamplayer, identify the predictably hot, trampy girl he's set his eyes on, and befriend her before the Vamplayer can turn her to do his bidding. This assignment turns out to be trickier than most when the Third Sister must battle the baddest vampire of all.",

        "publicationYear":2024,
        "description":"A dazzling and infuriating portrait of fifty years of corporate influence in Washington, The Wolves of K Street is a masterpiece of narrative nonfiction\u2014irresistibly dramatic, spectacularly timely, explosive in its revelations, and absolutely impossible to put down. In the 1970s, Washington\u2019s center of power began to shift away from elected officials in big marble buildings to a handful of savvy, handsomely paid operators who didn\u2019t answer to any fixed constituency. The cigar-chomping son of an influential congressman, an illustrious political fixer with a weakness for modern art, a Watergate-era dirty trickster, the city\u2019s favorite cocktail party host\u2014these were the sort of men who now ran Washington. Over four decades, they\u2019d chart new ways to turn their clients\u2019 cash into political leverage, abandoning favor-trading in smoke-filled rooms for increasingly sophisticated tactics, such as \u201cshadow lobbying,\u201d where underground campaigns sparked seemingly organic public outcries to pressure lawmakers into taking actions that would ultimately benefit corporate interests rather than ordinary citizens. With billions of dollars at play, these lobbying dynasties enshrined in Washington a pro-business consensus that would guide the country\u2019s political leaders\u2014Democrats and Republicans alike. A good lobbyist could ghostwrite a bill or even secretly kill a piece of legislation supported by the president, both houses of Congress, and a majority of Americans. Yet nothing lasts forever. Amid a populist backlash to the soaring inequality these influence peddlers helped usher in, DC\u2019s pro-business alliance suddenly began to fray. And while the lobbying establishment would continue to invent new ways to influence Washington, the men who\u2019d built K Street would soon find themselves under legal scrutiny, on the verge of financial collapse, or worse. One would turn up dead behind the eighteenth green of an exclusive golf club, with a $1,500 bottle of wine at his feet and a bullet in his head.",

        "description":"From the bestselling author of The Wax Pack, comes another eye\u2011opening road trip adventure into a pocket of iconic pop culture\u2014professional wrestling\u2014starring the Iron Sheik, Hulk Hogan, Tito Santana, and many more larger\u2011than\u2011life characters of the WWF of the 1980s. In 2005, Brad Balukjian left his position as a magazine fact-checker to pursue a dream job: partner with his childhood hero, The Iron Sheik (whose real name was Khosrow Vaziri), to write his biography. Things quickly went south, culminating in the Sheik threatening Balukjian\u2019s life. Now seventeen years later, Balukjian returns to the road in search of not only a reunion with the Sheik, but something much bigger: truth in a world built on illusion. Balukjian seeks out six of the Sheik\u2019s contemporaries, fellow witnesses to the World Wrestling Federation\u2019s (WWF) explosion in the mid-\u201880s, to unearth their true identities. As Balukjian drives 12,525 miles around the country, we revisit the heady days when these avatars of strength, villainy, and heroism first found fame and see where their journeys took them. From working out with Tony Atlas (Tony White) to visiting Hulk Hogan\u2019s (Terry Bollea) karaoke bar, we see where these men are now and how they have navigated the cliffs of fame. The Six Pack combines the spirit of a fan with the rigor of an investigative reporter, tracking down former WWF employees, childhood friends, and mutually curious archivists. Wrestling is perceived as a subculture without a cultural home, somewhere between sport and theater\u2014often dismissed as silly and low\u2011brow. But what makes this book so compelling is the humanity beneath each wrestler. The Iron Sheik, Hulk Hogan, and the rest of the cast were not characters in a comic book movie. They were real people, with families and feelings and bodies that could break. Most of them did, in fact, break; some have been repaired, but none of them will ever be the same.",

The Empress Seda is regaining control over those imperial cities who refused to bow the knee to her, but she draws her power from something more sinister than mere armies and war machines. Only her consort, the former spymaster Thalric, knows the truth, and now the assassins are coming and he finds his life and his loyalties under threat yet again.

I had devoured the first four books of the series, and the sheer emotional impact of them was starting to wear on me. I finally had to put the book down and take a breather, reading some fluffier things. When I came back to it, though, I fell right back in without missing a beat.<br \/><br \/>Finishing the book was very emotional, after spending so much time immersed in the universe. I had to go to the author\u2019s site RIGHT THEN and check through blog entries for reassurance. I found myself breathing ever so much more easily as soon as I found a post mentioning books six, seven, and eight. None of them are published yet, of course, but they\u2019re coming, and I\u2019m satisfied with that for now.<\/p>",

I wasn\u2019t too interested in what was going on with the Refek agents and their mobilization to have the Scorpions attack Khanaphes. The interactions between Thalric and Che are what interested me the most. Thoto was so annoying. I almost wish he was killed at some point. The mystery of the Masters in Khanaphes kept me engaged with the story, but in the end, I didn\u2019t get Ethmet, the First Minister. Was he really in touch with the Masters at all? He seemed just like a puppet, repeating old sayings. And why the Masters were dormant? And why after they woke up, found Che, let her go, and then went back to sleep? What was their goal? It seems like this mystery is the backdrop of what this series is really about.??<\/p>",

Addressing today\u2019s conversation about race, empowerment, and inclusion in America, Koa Beck, writer and former editor-in-chief of Jezebel, boldly examines the history of feminism, from the true mission of the suffragists to the rise of corporate feminism with clear-eyed scrutiny and meticulous detail. She also examines overlooked communities\u2014including Native American, Muslim, transgender, and more\u2014and their ongoing struggles for social change. With \u201cintellectually smart and emotionally intelligent\u201d (Patrisse Cullors, New York Times bestselling author and Black Lives Matter cofounder) writing, Beck meticulously documents how elitism and racial prejudice have driven the narrative of feminist discourse. Blending pop culture, primary historical research, and first-hand storytelling, she shows us how we have shut women out of the movement, and what we can do to correct our course for a new generation. Combining a scholar\u2019s understanding with hard data and razor-sharp cultural commentary, White Feminism \u201cis a rousing blueprint for a more inclusive \u2018new era of feminism\u2019\u201d (The Boston Globe).",

        "description":"Many of Peter F. Hamilton's dazzling novels, which offer startling perspectives on tomorrow's technological and cultural trends, are epic in scope, spanning vast stretches of space and time. And yet they are grounded in characters--human, alien, and other--who, for all their strangeness, are still able to touch our hearts and fire our imaginations. Now Hamilton returns to the universe of his acclaimed Commonwealth saga with The Temporal Void, the second volume in the trilogy that began with The Dreaming Void.Long ago, a human astrophysicist, Inigo, began dreaming scenes from the life of a remarkable human being named Edeard, who lived within the Void, a self-contained microuniverse at the heart of the galaxy. There, under the beneficent gaze of mysterious godlike entities, humans possessed uncanny psychic abilities, and Edeard's were the strongest of all. Equally strong was his determination to bring justice and freedom to a world terrorized by criminal violence and corruption. Inigo's inspirational dreams, shared by hundreds of millions throughout the galaxy-spanning gaiafield, gave birth to a religion--Living Dream. But when the appearance of a Second Dreamer seemed to trigger the expansion of the Void--an expansion that is devouring everything in its path--the Intersolar Commonwealth was thrown into turmoil. With the adherents of Living Dream determined to set forth on a dangerous pilgrimage into the Void, interstellar war threatens to erupt. With time running out, the fate of humanity hinges on a handful of people. There is Araminta, only now awakening to the unwelcome fact that she is the mysterious Second Dreamer--and to the dire responsibilities that go with it; Inigo, whose private dreams hint at a darker truth behind Edeard's legendary life; Paula Myo, the ruthless field operative of the Commonwealth, whose search for Araminta and Inigo is about to yield a most unpleasant surprise; and Justine, whose desperate gamble places her within the Void, where the godlike Skylords hold the power to save the universe . . . or destroy it.From the Hardcover edition.",

        "description":"History is filled with accounts of great leaders, but how did they become so? Written for emergent leaders in any endeavor, this new work from renowned consultant Richard Strozzi-Heckler offers a new approach to leadership. The first book of its kind to base business and management strength on integral body awareness, the book presents key principles such as shugyo, or self-cultivation, as crucial in developing the individual responsibility, social commitment, and moral and spiritual vision required to lead with authority and efficacy. The Leadership Dojo is based on three questions: What does a leader do? What are the character values most essential to exemplary leadership? How do you teach these values? Drawing on the wisdom of ages from Plato to the Bhagavad-Gita, from Thucydides to the Abidharma, the book asserts that understanding and answering these questions holds the key to superior leadership skills. Strozzi-Heckler teaches with real-world examples based on his wide experience training decision-makers at companies like AT&T and Microsoft. The book\u2019s multifaceted approach helps readers establish a powerful Leadership Presence, a platform from which they can take ethical action with compassion and pragmatic wisdom.",

        "publicationYear":2023,
        "description":"An unforgettable collection of diverse, remarkable lives inspired by \u201cOverlooked,\u201d the groundbreaking New York Times series that publishes the obituaries of extraordinary people whose deaths went unreported in the newspaper\u2014filled with nearly 200 full-color photos and new, never-before-published content Since 1851, The New York Times has published thousands of obituaries\u2014for heads of state, celebrities, scientists, and athletes. There\u2019s even one for the person who invented the sock puppet. But, until recently, only a fraction of the Times\u2019s obits chronicled the lives of women or people of color. The vast majority tell of the lives of men\u2014mostly white men. Started in 2018 as a series in the Obituary section, \u201cOverlooked\u201d has sought to rectify this, revisiting the Times\u2019s 170-year history to celebrate people who were left out. It seeks to correct past mistakes, establish a new precedent for equitable coverage of lives lost, and refocus society\u2019s lens on who is considered worthy of remembrance. Now, in the first book connected to the trailblazing series, Overlooked shares 66 extraordinary stories of women, BIPOC and LGBTQIA figures, and people with disabilities who have broken rules and overcome obstacles. Some achieved a measure of fame in their lifetime but were surprisingly omitted from the paper, including Ida B. Wells, Sylvia Plath, Alan Turing, and Major Taylor. Others were lesser-known, but noteworthy nonetheless, such as Katherine McHale Slaughterback, a farmer who found fame as \u201cRattlesnake Kate\u201d; \u00c1ngela Ruiz Robles, the inventor of an early e-reader; Terri Rogers, a transgender ventriloquist and magician; and Stella Young, a disabled comedian who rejected \u201cinspiration porn.\u201d These overlooked figures might have lived in different times, and had different experiences, but they were all ambitious and creative, and used their imaginations to invent, innovate, and change the world. Featuring stunning photographs, exclusive content about the process of writing obituaries, and contributions by writers such as Veronica Chambers, Jon Pareles, Amanda Hess, and more, this visually arresting book compels us to revisit who and what we value as a society\u2014and reminds us that some of our most important stories are hidden among the lives of those who have been overlooked.",

        "description":"Winner of the PEN\/Diamonstein-Spielvogel Award for the Art of the Essay Winner of the 2022 Southern Book Prize An Indie Next Selection for September 2021 A Book Marks Best Reviewed Essay Collection of 2021 A Literary Hub Most Anticipated Book of 2021 A Country Living Best Book of Fall 2021 A Garden & Gun Recommended Read for Fall 2021 A Book Marks Best Reviewed Book of September 2021 For the past four years, Margaret Renkl's columns have offered readers of The New York Times a weekly dose of natural beauty, human decency, and persistent hope from her home in Nashville. Now more than sixty of those pieces have been brought together in this sparkling new collection. \"People have often asked me how it feels to be the 'voice of the South,'\" writes Renkl in her introduction. \"But I'm not the voice of the South, and no one else is, either.\" There are many Souths--red and blue, rural and urban, mountain and coast, Black and white and brown--and no one writer could possibly represent all of them. In Graceland, At Last, Renkl writes instead from her own experience about the complexities of her homeland, demonstrating along the way how much more there is to this tangled region than many people understand. In a patchwork quilt of personal and reported essays, Renkl also highlights some other voices of the South, people who are fighting for a better future for the region. A group of teenagers who organized a youth march for Black Lives Matter. An urban shepherd whose sheep remove invasive vegetation. Church parishioners sheltering the homeless. Throughout, readers will find the generosity of spirit and deep attention to the world, human and nonhuman, that keep readers returning to her columns each Monday morning. From a writer who \"makes one of all the world's beings\" (NPR), Graceland, At Last is a book full of gifts for Southerners and non-Southerners alike.",

        "description":"In the 100 days of genocide that ravaged Rwanda in 1994, one million people were killed and as many as 500,000 women and girls were raped. No one was spared. Grandmothers were raped in front of their grandchildren; young girls witnessed their families being massacred before being taken as sex slaves. Nearly all the women who survived were victims of sexual violence or were profoundly affected by it. An astounding 70 percent are HIV-positive. In Rwanda's social and cultural climate, survivors who speak out face discrimination and isolation. The Men Who Killed Me features testimonials from 17 Rwandan survivors. Through their narratives and Samer Muscati's powerful portraits of them, these 16 women and one man bear witness not only to the crimes they and their countrymen endured, but to the incredible courage that has allowed them to survive and flourish.",

Have you ever felt stuck in a cycle of unresolved pain, playing offenses over and over in your mind You know you can't go on living like this, but you don't know what to do next. And you just aren't sure if you'll ever get past it. Lysa TerKeurst has walked this journey, wrestling with deep hurts and struggling to move forward. And she's discovered that-to find life-giving freedom-you have to let go of bound-up resentment and resistance to forgiving people who aren't willing to make things right.

The book depicts a great man aspiring to knighthood in a world that\u2019s falling to the forces of darkness. The epic plot is nothing new, but the other characters in the book all serve to highlight to strength of the main character\u2019s convictions and honour. The main character is the very symbol of the shining knight in armor, and the way he\u2019s portrayed still makes him a flawed human who strives for the perfection of what it means to be a knight.<\/p>",

        "publicationYear":2021,
        "description":"\u201cI highly recommend this book for all empaths and their loved ones.\u201d \u2014Jack Canfield, co-author of the #1 New York Times bestselling Chicken Soup for the Soul series The New York Times bestselling author of Dying to Be Me returns with an inspirational guide for sensitive people looking to fully harness their gifts of intuition and empathy in today\u2019s harsh world. International speaker, cancer survivor, and author of Dying to Be Me Anita Moorjani astounded fans across the globe with her New York Times bestselling book about overcoming cancer and her life-changing near-death experience. Now she returns with Sensitive Is the New Strong, a powerful, heartfelt book on harnessing and fostering empathic gifts in today\u2019s difficult, fear-based world. Empaths not only sense other people\u2019s emotions, but also absorb them\u2014sometimes to their own disadvantage, often leading to overwhelming sensory overload and feelings of confusion or low self-esteem. Their willingness to help and please others might make them prey to opportunists or cause them to give away more energy than they can afford. But Anita Moorjani argues that it\u2019s possible to turn this onslaught of emotional burden into a powerful tool. In a time when traits like sensitivity, kindness, and compassion are sorely undervalued, Moorjani helps empaths\u2014whether emerging or acknowledged\u2014navigate obstacles they may face and identify what makes them unique. Finally, she teaches them how to claim their true powers as empaths, to be their most authentic selves, shifting their own trajectory and leading to shift the trajectory of the planet in a more conscientious direction. Filled with eye-opening personal anecdotes, insights from other empaths, meditations, and self-affirming mantras, Sensitive Is the New Strong is an empowering book that demonstrates the positive power of sensitivity.",

It is in this world of shadows and secrecy that the occult history of the world has unfolded for untold generations. The Occult Art of War is a derivative work based upon the teachings of Sun Tzu in his ancient strategy manual, The Art of War. This text applies Sun Tzu's teachings to the conflicts that arise in the paths of those living in conjunction with the supernatural. This book not only lays out specific methods of strategy, but also provides a code of ethics and mental attitude for responsible application of the strategies. At its core this book is a manual for spiritual conflict and occult warfare.",

That\u2019s a different story \u2014 especially when they\u2019re Robin Hood outlaws of the Wild West being tailed by an uppity US Marshal half their age\u2026 From William W. Johnstone and J.A. Johnstone, legendary, bestselling masters of the classic Western with more than 50 million copies in print, the second in a rowdy new shoot-em-up series that proves old cowboys not only get wiser with age \u2013 they get bolder and crazier too\u2026 As proprietors of the growing D&T Cattle Company, Casey Tubbs and Eli Doolin finally have a business of their own. If they\u2019re going to spend their remaining years corraling cows, at least they can line their own pockets with the fruits of their labor instead of making wealthy ranchers even wealthier. Unfortunately, the meat market has seen better days and the D&T\u2019s finances are drying up faster than a rain puddle\u2014leaving Casey and Eli no choice but to procure cash by any means necessary\u2014usually robbing banks. Before long, Casey and Eli are the most wanted men in the West. Dogged by U.S. marshals and Texas Rangers, the old outlaws slip away time and again, gaining notoriety and being hailed as heroes by folks who have been victimized by corrupt bankers. Deputy U.S. Marshal Colton Gray, smart enough to suspect that the two cowboys are masquerading as old geezers, grudgingly respects Casey and Eli\u2019s grit. But he won\u2019t let that stop him from bringing them to justice. And if they don\u2019t come peacefully, then Colton will teach them to respect law and order from the barrel of his gun.

The mystery of the universe definitely isn't one we can flip to the end to see whodunit. That hasn't stopped physicists, astronomers, and philosophers from searching for clues! The topic is infinite (literally), but once you've read this book, you'll have a solid idea of our place in the universe-and even where the cosmos itself might be headed. In this Complete Idiot's Guide\u00ae, you'll explore...Major religions, philosophical, and scientific theories concerning the nature and origin of the universe.\"The theory of everything\"-one coherent model that would explain how all the forces and particles of nature work.The fascinating and even sometimes bizarre implications of the latest theories.",

        "description":"The definitive guide to statistical thinking Statistics are everywhere, as integral to science as they are to business, and in the popular media hundreds of times a day. In this age of big data, a basic grasp of statistical literacy is more important than ever if we want to separate the fact from the fiction, the ostentatious embellishments from the raw evidence -- and even more so if we hope to participate in the future, rather than being simple bystanders. In The Art of Statistics, world-renowned statistician David Spiegelhalter shows readers how to derive knowledge from raw data by focusing on the concepts and connections behind the math. Drawing on real world examples to introduce complex issues, he shows us how statistics can help us determine the luckiest passenger on the Titanic, whether a notorious serial killer could have been caught earlier, and if screening for ovarian cancer is beneficial. The Art of Statistics not only shows us how mathematicians have used statistical science to solve these problems -- it teaches us how we too can think like statisticians. We learn how to clarify our questions, assumptions, and expectations when approaching a problem, and -- perhaps even more importantly -- we learn how to responsibly interpret the answers we receive. Combining the incomparable insight of an expert with the playful enthusiasm of an aficionado, The Art of Statistics is the definitive guide to stats that every modern person needs.",

Is everyone going canoeing without me or is canoeing way less of a thing than it\u2019s made out to be? then this book is for you. Is Canada even real? It\u2019s a question that\u2019s being asked more and more, thanks to our waterproof, see-through, supposedly maple-scented currency and our improbably hot prime minister\u2019s assertion that Santa lives here. In the age of Google Maps and #factcheck, how could the existence of Canada be questioned? And yet how could a nation that\u2019s the home of toboggans, Drake, and KD exist in the same realm as, say, Belgium or Niger? Is Canada Even Real? examines the cultural factors behind the twenty-first-century monolithic myth of Canada, a nation that is lovable and real \u2014 if only in your imagination.",

        "description":"The Moon, shaken by the Anniversary Day tragedies, deals with devastation. The Earth Alliance believes another attack imminent, but no one knows where or when it will strike. Just like no one knows who ordered the attacks in the first place. The Moon's chief security office, Noelle DeRicci, does her best to hold the United Domes government together. But Retrieval Artist Miles Flint, dissatisfied with the investigation into the Anniversary Day events, begins an investigation of his own. He builds a coalition of shady operatives, off-the-books detectives, and his own daughter, Talia, in a race against time. A race, he quickly learns, that implicates organizations he trusts-and people he loves. Rusch offers up a well-told mystery with interesting characters and a complex, riveting storyline that includes a healthy dose of suspense, all building toward an ending that may not be what it appears. -RT Book Reviews The latest Retrieval Artist science fiction thriller is an engaging investigative whodunit starring popular Miles Flint on a comeback mission. The suspenseful storyline is fast-paced and filled with twists as the hero comes out of retirement to confront his worst nightmare. -GenreGoRoundReviews.com The book takes a fascinating turn into an alien underworld as Retrieval Artist extraordinaire Miles Flint returns along with his daughter Talia to uncover a plot that may dwarf the initial Anniversary Day attacks. This is juxtaposed against interplanetary politics and efforts by the Moon's Chief Security officer Noelle DeRicci to hold an uneasy United Domes government coalition together. We always like our intergalactic politics as truly alien, and Rusch delivers the goods. It's one thing to depict members of a Federation whining about treaties, quite another to depict motivations that are truly, well, alien. -Astroguyz.com",

        "publicationYear":2017,
        "description":"\"During the late 18th and early 19th centuries, there was a tubercular moment in which perceptions of the disease consumption (tuberculosis) became inextricably tied to contemporary concepts of beauty, playing out in the clothing fashions of the day. With the ravages of the illness widely regarded as conferring beauty on the sufferer, it became commonplace to regard tuberculosis as a positive affliction, one to be emulated in both beauty practices and dress. While medical writers of the time believed that the fashionable way of life of many women actually rendered them susceptible to the disease, Carolyn A. Day investigates the deliberate and widespread flouting of admonitions against these fashion practices in the pursuit of beauty. Through an exploration of contemporary social trends and medical advice revealed in medical writing, literature and personal papers, Consumptive Chic uncovers the intimate relationship between fashionable women's clothing and medical understandings of the illness. Illustrated with over 40 full color fashion plates, caricatures, medical images, and photographs of original garments, this is a compelling story of the complex connections between the body, beauty, and disease --and the rise of tubercular chic\"--Back cover.",

        "description":"El libro de no ficci\u00f3n del A\u00d1O Un best seller internacional con m\u00e1s de un mill\u00f3n de ejemplares vendidos. L\u00facido e iluminador: la historia de la humanidad en un solo volumen. Este es el fascinante relato de nuestra extraordinaria historia: de simios sin importancia a amos del mundo. \u00bfC\u00f3mo logr\u00f3 nuestra especie imponerse en la lucha por la existencia? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 nuestros ancestros recolectores se unieron para crear ciudades y reinos? \u00bfC\u00f3mo llegamos a creer en dioses, en naciones o en los derechos humanos; a confiar en el dinero, en los libros o en las leyes? \u00bfC\u00f3mo acabamos sometidos a la burocracia, a los horarios y al consumismo? \u00bfY c\u00f3mo ser\u00e1 el mundo en los milenios venideros? En Sapiens. De animales a dioses, Yuval Noah Harari traza una breve historia de la humanidad, desde los primeros humanos que caminaron sobre la Tierra hasta los radicales y a veces devastadores avances de las tres grandes revoluciones que nuestra especie ha protagonizado: la cognitiva, la agr\u00edcola y la cient\u00edfica. A partir de hallazgos de disciplinas tan diversas como la biolog\u00eda, la antropolog\u00eda, la paleontolog\u00eda o la econom\u00eda, Harari explora c\u00f3mo las grandes corrientes de la historia han modelado nuestra sociedad, los animales y las plantas que nos rodean e incluso nuestras personalidades. \u00bfHemos ganado en felicidad a medida que ha avanzado la historia? \u00bfSeremos capaces de liberar alguna vez nuestra conducta de la herencia del pasado? \u00bfPodemos hacer algo para influir en los siglos futuros? Audaz, ambicioso y provocador, este libro cuestiona todo lo que cre\u00edamos saber sobre el ser humano: nuestros or\u00edgenes, nuestras ideas, nuestras acciones, nuestro poder... y nuestro futuro. \u2022 El fuego nos dio poder. \u2022 La conversaci\u00f3n hizo posible que cooper\u00e1ramos. \u2022 La agricultura aliment\u00f3 nuestra ambici\u00f3n. \u2022 La mitolog\u00eda sostuvo la ley y el orden. \u2022 El dinero ofreci\u00f3 algo en lo que confiar. \u2022 Las contradicciones crearon la cultura. \u2022 La ciencia nos hizo imparables. Rese\u00f1as: \u00abAborda las cuestiones m\u00e1s importantes de la historia y del mundo modernos, y adem\u00e1s est\u00e1 escrito con un estilo v\u00edvido e inolvidable.\u00bb Jared Diamond \u00abRenueva la creencia en la capacidad de decidir de los propios lectores. El \u00e9xito m\u00e1s sorprendente y renovador de un libro de no ficci\u00f3n de la \u00faltima d\u00e9cada.\u00bb Shmuel Rosner, editor original (Israel) ENGLISH DESCRIPTION New York Times Bestseller From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity's creation and evolution\u2014a #1 international bestseller\u2014that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be \"human.\" One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one\u2014homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us? Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas. Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become? Featuring 27 photographs, 6 maps, and 25 illustrations\/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work is sure to spark debate and is essential reading for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James Gleick, Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem.",

                "comment":"<p>The Dark Angel by Seabury Quinn<br \/><br \/>Please give my Amazon review a helpful vote - https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/customer-reviews\/R3S9VBKF8FBV9S?ref=pf_ov_at_pdctrvw_srp<br \/><br \/>Given that this is a collection of 1920s-era Pulp fiction, I was totally surprised by how good these stories were.<br \/><br \/>According to the introduction, the author Seabury Quinn was a prolific writer of \u201cweird\u201d pulp fiction for Weird Fiction. Apparently, there were only a few volumes during the 1920s that didn\u2019t feature a story by Quinn about his character, Jules de Grandin. (Apparently, Quinn took Jules\u2019 last name from his middle name.)<br \/><br \/>There is no doubt that these stories are dated. They feature toe-curling racism, that is almost hilarious in its casual, unintended, offhanded offensiveness. Nonetheless, Quinn was a good writer. He was a lawyer who edited trade journals and wrote pamphlets on mortuary law.  Throughout these books, I was kept busy noting words that I had never or rarely seen.<br \/><br \/>The stories feature Jules de Grandin and his Watsonish side-kick, Dr. Townsend. Jules is French, small, carries a deadly little pistol in a holster under his left armpit, knows virtually everything about everything, and has an unlimited appreciation for his own genius and skill.  I am not sure if he was patterned on Agatha Christie\u2019s Hercule Poirer or vice versa, or both were patterned on a stereotype of a French man.<br \/><br \/>Jules and Dr. Townsend live in Harrisonburg, New Jersey, which seems to be as much a hotbed for supernatural mysteries as Cabot Cove was for intricate murders. Invariably, the pair are brought into a mystery, chase after it, with Jules eventually solving it. Sometimes the mystery has a Scooby-Doo feel to it; other times, it involves something truly supernatural.<br \/><br \/>The plots are probably the weakest part of the story. At times, it seems that they don\u2019t exactly hold together, even as Jules explains everything at the end, but the plot problems are made up for with character and humor.  Quinn was turning out a lot of these stories, and while he might not be able to come up with reliable plots, his characterization of Jules as a pompous, self-assured rooster, with badly translated French and American expressions were reliably humorous.<br \/><br \/>The introduction recommended not reading all these stories in one sitting. I think that is good advice.  Like reading Sherlock Holmes, letting the stories sit a bit, reading another book, perhaps, before returning, helps maintain the freshness of Quinn\u2019s characters and writing style.<\/p>",

For fans of Where\u2019d You Go, Bernadette and Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary comes \u201cjust the kind of comic novel we need right now\u201d (The Washington Post) about an Austin artist trying to figure out her life one letter to her ex-boyfriend at a time. Bridget Jones penned a diary; Roxy writes letters. Specifically: she writes letters to her hapless, rent-avoidant ex-boyfriend\u2014and current roommate\u2014Everett. This charming and funny twenty-something is under-employed (and under-romanced), and she\u2019s decidedly fed up with the indignities she endures as a deli maid at Whole Foods (the original), and the dismaying speed at which her beloved Austin is becoming corporatized. When a new Lululemon pops up at the intersection of Sixth and Lamar where the old Waterloo Video used to be, Roxy can stay silent no longer. As her letters to Everett become less about overdue rent and more about the state of her life, Roxy realizes she\u2019s ready to be the heroine of her own story. She decides to team up with her two best friends to save Austin\u2014and rescue Roxy\u2019s love life\u2014in whatever way they can. But can this spunky, unforgettable millennial keep Austin weird, avoid arrest, and find romance\u2014and even creative inspiration\u2014in the process? With timely themes and hilarious, laugh-out-loud moments, Roxy Letters is a smart and clever story that is \u201cbursting with originality, quirky wit, and delightful charm\u201d (Hannah Orenstein, author of Playing with Matches).",

In this scintillating book, journalist Victoria Finlay embarks on her own globe-circling search for the real stories behind some of the gems we prize most. Blending adventure travel, geology, exciting new research, and her own irresistible charm, Finlay has fashioned a treasure hunt for some of the most valuable, glamorous, and mysterious substances on earth. With the same intense curiosity and narrative flair she displayed in her widely-praised book Color, Finlay journeys from the underground opal churches of outback Australia to the once pearl-rich rivers of Scotland; from the peridot mines on an Apache reservation in Arizona to the remote ruby mines in the mountains of northern Burma. She risks confronting scorpions to crawl through Cleopatra\u2019s long-deserted emerald mines, tries her hand at gem cutting in the dusty Sri Lankan city where Marco Polo bartered for sapphires, and investigates a rumor that fifty years ago most of the world\u2019s amber was mined by prisoners in a Soviet gulag. Jewels is a unique and often exhilarating voyage through history, across cultures, deep into the earth\u2019s mantle, and up to the glittering heights of fame, power, and wealth. From the fabled curse of the Hope Diamond, to the disturbing truths about how pearls are cultured, to the peasants who were once executed for carrying amber to the centuries-old quest by magicians and scientists to make a perfect diamond, Jewels tells dazzling stories with a wonderment and brilliance truly worthy of its subjects.",

Virgin heroine, gay best friend, overly sexual roommate\/friend, hottie billionaire, insta-love, stupid miscommunications, and it was just all too much. The main characters go from not knowing each other outside of a professional setting to proclaiming their love for each other after a couple of weeks. The humor felt forced, like the authors wanted to write this hilarious romantic comedy but the jokes fell flat. It just didn\u2019t live up to the hype for me and I won\u2019t be continuing with the series.<\/p>",

One messy, tangled case that can shatter a career. Turn a lawman into a renegade. And make him question words like honor, valor, and duty. For Jack Reacher, this is that case.New Year's Day, 1990. The Berlin Wall is coming down.  The world is changing.  And in a North Carolina \"hot-sheets\" motel, a two-star general is found dead. His briefcase is missing. Nobody knows what was in it. Within minutes Jack Reacher has his orders: Control the situation. But this situation can't be controlled. Within hours the general's wife is murdered hundreds of miles away. Then the dominoes really start to fall.Two Special Forces soldiers--the toughest of the tough--are taken down, one at a time. Top military commanders are moved from place to place in a bizarre game of chess. And somewhere inside the vast worldwide fortress that is the U.S. Army, Jack Reacher--an ordinarily untouchable investigator for the 110th Special Unit--is being set up as a fall guy with the worst enemies a man can have.But Reacher won't quit. He's fighting a new kind of war. And he's taking a young female lieutenant with him on a deadly hunt that leads them from the ragged edges of a rural army post to the winding streets of Paris to a confrontation with an enemy he didn't know he had. With his French-born mother dying--and divulging to her son one last, stunning secret--Reacher is forced to question everything he once believed...about his family, his career, his loyalties--and himself. Because this soldier's son is on his way into the darkness, where he finds a tangled drama of desperate desires and violent death--and a conspiracy more chilling, ingenious, and treacherous than anyone could have guessed.From the Hardcover edition.",

        "publicationYear":2021,
        "description":"This book exposes the dangerously imperfect forensic evidence that we rely on for criminal convictions. \"That's not my fingerprint, your honor,\" said the defendant, after FBI experts reported a \"100-percent identification.\" The FBI was wrong. It is shocking how often they are. Autopsy of a Crime Lab is the first book to catalog the sources of error and the faulty science behind a range of well-known forensic evidence, from fingerprints and firearms to forensic algorithms. In this devastating forensic takedown, noted legal expert Brandon L. Garrett poses the questions that should be asked in courtrooms every day: Where are the studies that validate the basic premises of widely accepted techniques such as fingerprinting? How can experts testify with 100-percent certainty about a fingerprint, when there is no such thing as a 100 percent match? Where is the quality control at the crime scenes and in the laboratories? Should we so readily adopt powerful new technologies like facial recognition software and rapid DNA machines? And why have judges been so reluctant to consider the weaknesses of so many long-accepted methods? Taking us into the lives of the wrongfully convicted or nearly convicted, into crime labs rocked by scandal, and onto the front lines of promising reform efforts driven by professionals and researchers alike, Autopsy of a Crime Lab illustrates the persistence and perniciousness of shaky science and its well-meaning practitioners.",

        "description":"Behind the front lines of a crusade to scour the world of magic, the crew of a field hospital confront the horrors of war. A companion novel to Adrian Tchaikovsky's award-winning fantasy novel City of Last ChancesCity-by-city, kingdom-by-kingdom, the Palleseen have sworn to bring Perfection and Correctness to an imperfect world. As their legions scour the world of superstition with the bright flame of reason, so they deliver a mountain of ragged, holed and scorched flesh to the field hospital tents just behind the front line.Which is where Yasnic, one-time priest, healer and rebel, finds himself. Reprieved from the gallows and sent to war clutching a box of orphan Gods, he has been sequestered to a particularity unorthodox medical unit. Led by 'the Butcher', an ogre of a man who's a dab hand with a bone-saw and an alchemical tincture, the unit's motley crew of conscripts, healers and orderlies are no strangers to the horrors of war. Theirs is an unspeakable trade: elbow-deep in gore they have a first-hand view of the suffering caused by flesh-rending monsters, arcane magical weaponry and embittered enemy soldiers. Entrusted - for now - with saving lives deemed otherwise un-saveable, the field hospital's crew face a precarious existence. Their work with unapproved magic, necromancy, demonology and Yasnic's thoroughly illicit Gods could lead to the unit being disbanded, arrested or worse.Beset by enemies within and without, the last thing anyone needs is a miracle...

It scratched an itch for me that I didn\u2019t know I had - where a revolution happens not due to any particular group of people or a cause or anything singular. Just one chance dice game, that sets up and intensifies the existing tensions within the city. It was unique and it was bold and it was funny at parts and I loved it for just that. <br \/><br \/>I love House of Open Wounds for completely different reasons. There are certainly gems of something I have always wanted for other books but nothing completely unique. Reading through House of Open Wounds reminded me of some of my favourite parts in the Malazan series with the irreverent (lol) bickering native to the corps. The ending as well tied together together the threads set up through out the book beautifully reminiscent of the Malazan books again. <br \/><br \/>What sets this book apart from its predecessor is the characters. City of Last Chances while having a decent size of characters did not make me endear to any one of them. House of Open Wounds brings together a motley group of freaks who all bounce off of each other in interesting and fun ways. The world as well opens up to more than just Ilmar and it benefits heavily from that. The Palleseen are no longer straight up villainous but just people with their flaws and motivations. I still think City of Last Chances had the better world building which allowed House of Open Wounds to leapfrog off of that into more interesting areas.<br \/><br \/>idk i loved the book.<\/p>",

HYDE IN THE SHADOWS Daniel Carter was a London cop who just wanted to do the right thing. But during a raid on an organ-selling chop shop, he is almost torn to pieces by monsters. And no one believes him. Hurt and crippled, his career over and his life in ruins, Daniel is suddenly presented with a chance at redemption. And revenge.

A fairly good representation of the story. It makes great use of graphics. The composition is really good, and the typography is interesting. <br \/><br \/>I really rather enjoyed this one. Same engaging writing as book one. I felt the pacing in this one was much better. It held my interest from beginning to end. The mystery in this one didn\u2019t have the same impact as the one in the previous book, but I was still surprised at who turned out to be the guilty party. <br \/><br \/>Again we have a whole cast of interesting and likable secondary characters. There was a fascinating addition in this book (Declan Bishop), and I am extremely intrigued by him. As well as London\u2019s two brothers. Although one seems to already be in a relationship. I was a tiny bit disappointed we didn\u2019t get more Zach (the bad boy biker brother), but his book seems to be up next with Jinx as his heroine.<br \/><br \/> <br \/><br \/>As for the main characters. Well, both were extremely likable. There was NO angst or drama relationship wise in this book. They just meet, got together and stayed together. I liked them as a couple, but I didn\u2019t find them particularly exciting as a couple. In fact, I would say this book leaned way more towards the suspense side than it did the romance side. Which was fine since the mystery was intriguing enough that it carried the book.<br \/><br \/>After reading both book one and two back to back, I can definitely say that this series has me hooked. The brothers. The friends and family connections. The continuing mystery. It all gives me a ROCK CHICK like vibe, and I LOVE that series, so me enjoying this one really in a no brainer. Two thumbs up from yours truly.<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>",

Wer w\u00fcrde mitmachen? Wie w\u00fcrden die M\u00e4nner reagieren? Wie die Chefs und die Familienv\u00e4ter? <br \/><br \/>Besonders gut gefallen haben mir die Einsch\u00fcbe aus Sicht von \u201eGeb\u00e4rmutter\u201c und \u201ePistole\u201c.<br \/><br \/>Den Weg zu dieser stillen Revolte kann man gut nachvollziehen. Die Wut der Frauen ist greifbar.<br \/><br \/>Was ich etwas zu kurz gedacht finde, ist die zu krasse Trennung zwischen Mann und Frau. Es ist ein ziemliches schwarz-wei\u00df denken und Verhalten, das sich in dem Buch wiederspiegelt.<br \/><br \/>Alle M\u00e4nner (au\u00dfer dem einen m\u00e4nnlichen Protagonisten) werden konsequent als Gefahr dargestellt, alle verhalten sich wie Raubtiere, die Frauen als minderwertig ansehen und sie objektifizieren. Nat\u00fcrlich haben sie komplett kein Verst\u00e4ndnis f\u00fcr die Aktion der Frauen und wenn keine in den Clubs anzutreffen sind, machen sie sich auf den Weg um welche gewaltsam zur Befriedigung ihrer Bed\u00fcrfnisse zu zwingen.<br \/>Nat\u00fcrlich sind alle V\u00e4ter herrschs\u00fcchtige Patriarchen und alle Chefs ignorant gegen\u00fcber den Forderungen weiblicher Angestellter. <br \/>Nat\u00fcrlich reagiert die Regierung direkt mit Gesetzen die sich gegen die Frauen richten. <br \/><br \/>Es mag gewollt sein, aber diese krasse Einteilung und das tun, als g\u00e4be es weder m\u00e4nnliche Feminist*innen noch Frauen, die das Patriarchat bef\u00fcrworten, macht die ganzen \u00dcberlegungen obsolet und absurd. Mag sein, dass \u201edie M\u00e4nner\u201c teilweise so reagierten, aber dass niemand ohne Hintergedanken \u201edie Frauen\u201c unterst\u00fctzen w\u00fcrden, ist einfach unglaubhaft und zerst\u00f6rt damit die grunds\u00e4tzlich spannende Grundidee (zumindest f\u00fcr mich).<br \/><br \/>Ein weiterer Punkt, der mich beim Lesen gest\u00f6rt hat, war die Stilisierung des m\u00e4nnlichen Protagonisten als \u201eAusl\u00e4nder (TM)\u201c. Es werden Klischees bedient und nicht n\u00e4her drauf eingegangen, was der Ursprung der Familie ist, was vielleicht die ein oder andere Aktion und Reaktion erkl\u00e4rt h\u00e4tte. <br \/>Hier kann es auch sein, dass ich allein stehe mit dieser Meinung und dass es durchaus gewollt ist, den Hintergrund so gering wie m\u00f6glich zu halten. Mich hat es allerdings irritiert.<br \/><br \/>Schade, denn sprachlich ist das Buch wieder wunderbar geschrieben und wie gesagt, die Frage, die dem ganzen zugrunde liegt ist durchaus spannend. <br \/><br \/>Die H\u00f6rbuchversion ist zudem wirklich toll von allen Sprechern eingelesen worden.<\/p>",

        "description":"From Gregg Olsen, bestselling author of If You Tell, comes the heartbreaking true story of a mother's darkest secrets coming to light in Cruel Deception. In and out of hospitals since birth, angelic nine-month-old Morgan Reid finally succumbed to what appeared to be Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Morgan's Texas-born mother Tanya, a nurse and devoted wife, pulled up stakes with her grieving husband Jim, and moved on. It was the best way to put the past behind them. Until their son Michael, a boy who by all accounts was terrified of his mother, began showing signs of the same affliction that stole the life of his baby sister... First, the suspicion: Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy. Then, Tanya was charged and convicted with felony child abuse of her son. She was later tried and ultimately convicted for first degree murder of Morgan. It would become a landmark trial that unfolded in a series of reversals and bizarre twists of fate as it gradually revealed another side of Tanya Reid--of her own troubling childhood and the dark secrets that drove a woman to the cruelest deception of all.",

Would re-read just for the good times.\u00a0<br \/><br \/>I\u2019m drawn to Dramione usually because Draco can match her intellectually compared to Ron. While I\u2019m drawn to Romione because Ron is an uncomplicated himbo that can help her mellow out. However, in this fic Draco is playing that role. It\u2019s cute for a switch up in this case but honestly Draco loses his Draco-ness and could have been subbed in with any character from the HP universe and the story would have been the exact same.\u00a0<br \/><br \/>Unnecessary epilogues are my pet peeve and this one has one. Usually epilogues show the result of growth, or give closure. In this epilogue Hermione continues to be petty and resentful and Draco continues to be a himbo.<\/p>",

Hickman's insanity plea was the first of its kind in the history of California, and the nature of the crime led to a media frenzy unlike any the country had seen\"--Page 4 of cover.",
