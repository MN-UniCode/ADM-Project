Jill Lepore offers a magisterial account of the origins and rise of a divided nation an urgently needed reckoning with the beauty and tragedy of American history Written in elegiac prose Lepores groundbreaking investigation places truth itselfa devotion to facts proof and evidenceat the center of the nations history The American experiment rests on three ideasthese truths  Jefferson called thempolitical equality natural rights and the sovereignty of the people And it rests too on a fearless dedication to inquiry Lepore argues because selfgovernment depends on it But has the nation and democracy itself delivered on that promise This book tells this uniquely American story beginning in 1492 asking whether the course of events over more than five centuries has proven the nations truths or belied them To answer that question Lepore traces the intertwined histories of American politics law journalism and technology from the colonial town meeting to the nineteenthcentury party machine from talk radio to twentyfirstcentury Internet polls from Magna Carta to the Patriot Act from the printing press to Facebook News Along the way Lepores sovereign chronicle is filled with arresting sketches of both wellknown and lesserknown Americans from a parade of presidents and a rogues gallery of political mischief makers to the intrepid leaders of protest movements including Frederick Douglass the famed abolitionist orator William Jennings Bryan the threetime presidential candidate and ultimately tragic populist Pauli Murray the visionary civil rights strategist and Phyllis Schlafly the uncredited architect of modern conservatism Americans are descended from slaves and slave owners from conquerors and the conquered from immigrants and from people who have fought to end immigration A nation born in contradiction will fight forever over the meaning of its history  Lepore writes but engaging in that struggle by studying the past is part of the work of citizenship The past is an inheritance a gift and a burden  this book observes It cant be shirked Theres nothing for it but to get to know itJacket', 'language': 'English', 'genres': ['History',

and its devastating repercussionsIn December 1972 Jean McConville a thirtyeightyearold mother of ten was dragged from her Belfast home by masked intruders her children clinging to her legs They never saw her again Her abduction was one of the most notorious episodes of the vicious conflict known as The Troubles Everyone in the neighborhood knew the IRA was responsible But in a climate of fear and paranoia no one would speak of it In 2003 five years after an accord brought an uneasy peace to Northern Ireland a set of human bones was discovered on a beach McConvilles children knew it was their mother when they were told a blue safety pin was attached to the dresswith so many kids she had always kept it handy for diapers or ripped clothesPatrick Radden Keefes mesmerizing book on the bitter conflict in Northern Ireland and its aftermath uses the McConville case as a starting point for the tale of a society wracked by a violent guerrilla war a war whose consequences have never been reckoned with The brutal violence seared not only people like the McConville children but also IRA members embittered by a peace that fell far short of the goal of a united Ireland and left them wondering whether the killings they committed were not justified acts of war but simple murders From radical and impetuous IRA terrorists such as Dolours Price who when she was barely out of her teens

about the longterm evolution of inequality the concentration of wealth and the prospects for economic growth lie at the heart of political economy But satisfactory answers have been hard to find for

century to uncover key economic and social patterns His findings will transform debate and set the agenda for the next generation of thought about wealth and inequalityPiketty shows that modern

Ireland Interviewing people on both sides of the conflict he transforms the tragic damage and waste of the era into a searing utterly gripping saga  New York Times Book Review Ten Best Books of the YearFrom awardwinning New Yorker staff writer Patrick Radden Keefe a stunning intricate narrative about a notorious killing in Northern Ireland and its devastating repercussionsIn December 1972 Jean McConville a thirtyeightyearold mother of ten was dragged from her Belfast home by masked intruders her children clinging to her legs They never saw her again Her abduction was one of the most notorious episodes of the vicious conflict known as The Troubles Everyone in the neighborhood knew the IRA was responsible But in a climate of fear and paranoia no one would speak of it In 2003 five years after an accord brought an uneasy peace to Northern Ireland a set of human bones was discovered on a beach McConvilles children knew it was their mother when they were told a blue safety pin was attached to the dresswith so many kids she had always kept it handy for diapers or ripped clothesPatrick Radden Keefes mesmerizing book on the bitter conflict in Northern Ireland and its aftermath

people like the McConville children but also IRA members embittered by a peace that fell far short of the goal of a united Ireland and left them wondering whether the killings they committed were not justified acts of war but simple murders From radical and impetuous IRA terrorists such as Dolours Price who when she was barely out of her teens was already planting bombs in London and targeting

about a notorious killing in Northern Ireland and its devastating repercussionsIn December 1972 Jean McConville a thirtyeightyearold mother of ten was dragged from her Belfast home by masked intruders her children clinging to her legs They never saw her again Her abduction was one of the most notorious episodes of the vicious conflict known as The Troubles Everyone in the neighborhood knew the IRA was responsible But in a climate of fear and paranoia no one would speak of it In 2003 five years after an accord brought an uneasy peace to Northern Ireland a set of human bones was discovered on a beach McConvilles children knew it was their mother when they were told a blue safety pin was attached to the dresswith so many kids she had always kept it handy for diapers or ripped clothesPatrick Radden Keefes mesmerizing book on the bitter conflict in Northern Ireland and its aftermath uses the McConville case as a starting point for the tale of a society wracked by a violent guerrilla war a war whose consequences have never been reckoned with The brutal violence seared not only people like the McConville children but also IRA members embittered by a peace that fell far short of the goal of a united Ireland and left them wondering whether the killings they committed were not justified acts of war but simple murders From radical and impetuous IRA terrorists such as Dolours Price who when she was barely out of her teens was already planting bombs in London and targeting informers for execution to the ferocious IRA mastermind known as The Dark to the spy games and dirty schemes of

sovereignty of the people And it rests too on a fearless dedication to inquiry Lepore argues because selfgovernment depends on it But has the nation and democracy itself delivered on that promise This book tells this uniquely American story beginning in 1492 asking whether the course of events over more than five centuries has proven the nations truths or belied them To answer that question Lepore traces the intertwined histories of American politics law journalism and technology from the colonial town meeting to the nineteenthcentury party machine from talk radio to twentyfirstcentury Internet polls from Magna Carta to the Patriot Act from the printing press to Facebook News Along the way Lepores sovereign chronicle is filled with arresting sketches of both wellknown and lesserknown Americans from a parade of presidents and a rogues gallery of political mischief makers to the intrepid leaders of protest movements including Frederick Douglass the famed abolitionist orator William Jennings Bryan the threetime presidential candidate and ultimately tragic populist Pauli Murray the visionary civil rights strategist and Phyllis Schlafly the uncredited architect of modern conservatism Americans are descended from slaves and slave owners from conquerors and the conquered from immigrants and from people who have fought to end immigration A nation born in contradiction

conflict he transforms the tragic damage and waste of the era into a searing utterly gripping saga  New York Times Book Review Ten Best Books of the YearFrom awardwinning New Yorker staff writer Patrick Radden Keefe a stunning intricate narrative about a notorious killing in Northern Ireland and its devastating repercussionsIn December 1972 Jean McConville a thirtyeightyearold mother of ten was dragged from her Belfast home by masked intruders her children clinging to her legs They never saw her again Her abduction was one of the most notorious episodes of the vicious conflict known as The Troubles Everyone in the neighborhood knew the IRA was responsible But in a climate of fear and paranoia no one would speak of it In 2003 five years after an accord brought an uneasy peace to Northern Ireland a set of human bones was discovered on a beach McConvilles children knew it was their mother when they were told a blue safety pin was attached to the dresswith so many kids she had always kept it handy for diapers or ripped clothesPatrick Radden Keefes mesmerizing book on the bitter conflict in Northern Ireland and its aftermath uses the McConville case as a starting point for the tale of a society wracked by a violent guerrilla war a war whose consequences have never been reckoned with The brutal violence seared not only people like the McConville children but also IRA members embittered by a peace that fell far short of the goal of a united Ireland and left them wondering whether the killings they committed were not justified acts of war but simple murders From radical and impetuous IRA terrorists such as Dolours Price who when she was barely out of her teens was already planting bombs in London and targeting informers for execution to the ferocious IRA

Strait twelve thousand years ago existed mainly in small nomadic bands and lived so lightly on the land that the Americas was for all practical purposes still a vast wilderness But as Charles C Mann now makes clear archaeologists and anthropologists have spent the last thirty years proving these and many other longheld assumptions wrongIn a book that startles and persuades Mann reveals how a new generation of researchers equipped with novel scientific techniques came to previously unheardof conclusions Among them In 1491 there were probably more people living in the Americas than in Europe Certain citiessuch as Tenochtitlan the Aztec capitalwere far greater in population than any contemporary European city Furthermore Tenochtitlan unlike any capital in Europe at that time had running water beautiful botanical gardens and immaculately clean streets The earliest cities in the Western Hemisphere were thriving before the Egyptians built the great pyramids PreColumbian Indians in Mexico developed corn by a breeding process so sophisticated that the journal Science recently described it as mans first and perhaps the greatest feat of genetic engineering Amazonian Indians learned how to farm the rain forest without destroying ita process scientists are studying today in the hope of regaining this lost knowledge Native Americans transformed their land so completely that Europeans arrived in a hemisphere already  massively landscaped by human beingsMann sheds clarifying light on the methods used to arrive at these new visions of the preColumbian Americas and how they

Odell wrote about the importance of disconnecting from the attention economy to spend time in quiet contemplation But what if you dont have time to spend In order to answer this seemingly simple question Odell took a deep dive into the fundamental structure of our society and found that the clock we live by was built for profit not people This is why our lives even in leisure have come to seem like a series of moments to be bought sold and processed ever more efficiently Odell shows us how our painful relationship to time is inextricably connected not only to persisting social inequities but to the climate crisis existential dread and a lethal fatalism This dazzling subversive and deeply hopeful book offers us different ways to experience timeinspired by preindustrial cultures ecological cues and geological timescalesthat can bring within reach a more humane responsive way of living As planetbound animals we live inside shortening and lengthening days alongside gardens growing birds migrating and cliffs eroding the stretchy quality of waiting and desire the way the present may suddenly feel marbled with childhood memory the slow but sure procession of a pregnancy the time it takes to heal from injuries Odell urges us to become stewards of these different rhythms of life in which time is not reducible to standardized units and instead forms the very medium of possibility Saving Time tugs at the seams of reality as we know itthe way we experience time itselfand rearranges it imagining a world not centered on work the office clock or the profit

as a novel  Keefe uses McConvilles murder as a prism to tell the history of the Troubles in Northern Ireland Interviewing people on both sides of the conflict he transforms the tragic damage and waste of the era into a searing utterly gripping saga  New York Times Book Review Ten Best Books of the YearFrom awardwinning New Yorker staff writer Patrick Radden Keefe a stunning intricate narrative about a notorious killing in Northern Ireland and its devastating repercussionsIn December 1972 Jean McConville a thirtyeightyearold mother of ten was dragged from her Belfast home by masked intruders her children clinging to her legs They never saw her again Her abduction was one of the most notorious episodes of the vicious conflict known as The Troubles Everyone in the neighborhood knew the IRA was responsible But in a climate of fear and paranoia no one would speak of it In 2003 five years after an accord brought an uneasy peace to Northern Ireland a set of human bones was discovered on a beach McConvilles children knew it was their mother when they were told a blue safety pin was attached to the dresswith so many kids she had always kept it handy for diapers or ripped clothesPatrick Radden Keefes mesmerizing book on the bitter conflict in Northern Ireland and its aftermath uses the McConville case as a starting point for the tale of a society wracked by a violent guerrilla war a war whose consequences have never been reckoned with The brutal violence seared not only people like the McConville children but also IRA members embittered by a peace that fell far short of the goal of a united Ireland and left them wondering whether the killings they committed were not justified acts of war but simple murders From radical and impetuous IRA terrorists such as Dolours Price who when she was barely out of her teens was already planting bombs in London and targeting informers for execution to the ferocious IRA mastermind known as The Dark to the spy games and dirty schemes of the British Army to Gerry Adams who negotiated the peace but betrayed his hardcore comrades by denying his IRA pastSay Nothing conjures a world of passion betrayal vengeance and anguish', 'language':

investigation places truth itselfa devotion to facts proof and evidenceat the center of the nations history The American experiment rests on three ideasthese truths  Jefferson called thempolitical equality natural rights and the sovereignty of the people And it rests too on a fearless dedication to inquiry Lepore argues because selfgovernment depends on it But has the nation and democracy itself delivered on that promise This book tells this uniquely American story beginning in 1492 asking whether the course of events over more than five centuries has proven the nations truths or belied them To answer that question Lepore traces the intertwined histories of American politics law journalism and technology from the colonial town meeting to the nineteenthcentury party machine from talk radio to twentyfirstcentury Internet polls from Magna Carta to the Patriot Act from the printing press to Facebook News Along the way Lepores sovereign chronicle is filled with arresting sketches of both wellknown and lesserknown Americans from a parade of presidents and a rogues gallery of political mischief makers to the intrepid leaders of protest movements including Frederick Douglass the famed abolitionist orator William Jennings Bryan the threetime presidential candidate and ultimately tragic populist Pauli Murray the visionary civil rights strategist and Phyllis Schlafly the uncredited architect of modern conservatism Americans are descended from slaves and slave owners from conquerors and the conquered from immigrants and from people who have fought to end immigration A nation born in contradiction will fight forever over the meaning of its history  Lepore writes but engaging in that struggle by studying the past is part of the work of citizenship The

Ireland Interviewing people on both sides of the conflict he transforms the tragic damage and waste of the era into a searing utterly gripping saga  New York Times Book Review Ten Best Books of the YearFrom awardwinning New Yorker staff writer Patrick Radden Keefe a stunning intricate narrative about a notorious killing in Northern Ireland and its devastating repercussionsIn December 1972 Jean McConville a thirtyeightyearold mother of ten was dragged from her Belfast home by masked intruders her children clinging to her legs They never saw her again Her abduction was one of the most notorious episodes of the vicious conflict known as The Troubles Everyone in the neighborhood knew the IRA was responsible But in a climate of fear and paranoia no one would speak of it In 2003 five years after an accord brought an uneasy peace to Northern Ireland a set of human bones was discovered on a beach McConvilles children knew it was their mother when they were told a blue safety pin was attached to the dresswith so many kids she had always kept it handy for diapers or ripped clothesPatrick Radden Keefes mesmerizing book on the bitter conflict in Northern Ireland and its aftermath

people like the McConville children but also IRA members embittered by a peace that fell far short of the goal of a united Ireland and left them wondering whether the killings they committed were not justified acts of war but simple murders From radical and impetuous IRA terrorists such as Dolours Price who when she was barely out of her teens was already planting bombs in London and targeting

Code of Baseball A Ruined Childhood  A Trip Down Memory LaneAnyone that became a teenager in the early 1970s will immediately take to John Grishams Calico Joe Especially one that grew up in New York and liked baseball I know I was one of them Grishams book revolves around a washed up aging picture for the New York Mets named Paul Tracy and his mercurial volatile relationship with his son Paul Added in is a rookie phenom for the Cubs named Joe Castle Castle dubbed Calico Joe sets major league records in his 1973 rookie debut for consecutive games safely hit Paul Castle fell in love with Calico Joe even keeping a scrapbook of his accolades unbeknownst to his father Grisham portrays Warren as a philanderer a beanball artist a drunkard and an abusive husband and father Shades of the Tony Conigliaro incident are introduced when the Cubs come into town to play the Mets with the National League East pennant on the line With Paul and his disgruntled mother in the stands at Shea Stadium the two watch as Castle goes up against his father after successfully pounding Warren for a hit his first time upThe code of baseball is introduced at least Warrens conception of it If a batsman shows up the pitcher in any way the previous at bat or is a cocky rookie the next at bat will surely be a beanball However Warren was a cruel mean headhunter and demanded Paul be like him in playing Little League Without any remorse the senior Tracy will throw at anyones head as revenge rarely missing In Castles second at bat the lives of both the Castle and Tracy are forever changed The ironies involved and the unpredictable twists of fate make this novel truly amazing The names thrown out eg Tom Seaver Bobby Murcer Ron Santo Ferguson Jenkins etc bring back such vivid memories of a readers lost youthhood that it is impossible to not love and embrace this fantastically written novel Even more realistic are the memories Grisham introduces such as his descriptions of the Long Island Railroad being ridden Willets Point in Flushing and both old Shea and Yankee Stadium Wrigley Field etc with fitting descriptions of the temperaments of the fans of each Grisham fast forwards forty years later and cleverly plays out a scenario involving Warren dying of cancer a caustic Paul and a forever enfeebled Joe CastleThe realism is strikingly apparent regardless of Grishams introduction of a fictional protagonist In fact the author cleverly let former Cub infielder Don Kessinger proof read and correct Calico Joe for realism Kessingers interjections make this story so absorbing captivating and realistic that anyone reading this cannot but be spellbound by Calico Joe Memories flash of Carl Mays Ray Chapman and Tony C Mays was a righthanded pitcher in Major League Baseball from 1915 to 1929 Despite impressive career statistics he is primarily remembered for throwing a beanball on August 16 1920 that struck and killed Ray Chapman of the Cleveland Indians making Chapman the only Major League player to die as a direct result of an injury sustained on the field Similarly Tony Conigliaro nicknamed Tony C played for the Boston Red Sox during their Impossible Dream season of 1967 He was hit in the face by a pitch from Jack Fisher causing a severe eye injury and derailing his career Though he would make a dramatic comeback from the injury his career was not the same afterwards Whether you like baseball or not Calico Joe has something for any reader guaranteeing a satisfying read', 'language': 'English', 'genres': ['Fiction', 'Young Adult']}]"

of the Troubles in Northern Ireland Interviewing people on both sides of the conflict he transforms the tragic damage and waste of the era into a searing utterly gripping saga  New York Times Book Review Ten Best Books of the YearFrom awardwinning New Yorker staff writer Patrick Radden Keefe a stunning intricate narrative about a notorious killing in Northern Ireland and its devastating repercussionsIn December 1972 Jean McConville a thirtyeightyearold mother of ten was dragged from her Belfast home by masked intruders her children clinging to her legs They never saw her again Her abduction was one of the most notorious episodes of the vicious conflict known as The Troubles Everyone in the neighborhood knew the IRA was responsible But in a climate of fear and paranoia no one would speak of it In 2003 five years after an accord brought an uneasy peace to Northern Ireland a set of human bones was discovered on a beach McConvilles children knew it was their mother when they were told a blue safety pin was attached to the dresswith so many kids she had always kept it handy for diapers or ripped clothesPatrick Radden Keefes mesmerizing book on the bitter conflict in Northern Ireland and its aftermath uses the McConville case as a starting point for the tale of a society wracked by a violent guerrilla war a war whose consequences have never been reckoned with The brutal violence seared not only people like the McConville children but also IRA members embittered by a peace that fell far short of the goal of a united Ireland and left them wondering whether the killings they committed were not justified acts of war but simple murders From radical and impetuous IRA terrorists such as Dolours Price who when she was barely out of her teens was already planting bombs in London and targeting informers for execution to the ferocious IRA mastermind known as The Dark to the spy games and dirty schemes of the British Army to Gerry Adams who negotiated the peace but betrayed his hardcore comrades by denying his IRA pastSay Nothing conjures a world of passion betrayal vengeance and anguish', 'language': 'English', 'genres': ['History', 'War', 'Nonfiction',

sovereignty of the people And it rests too on a fearless dedication to inquiry Lepore argues because selfgovernment depends on it But has the nation and democracy itself delivered on that promise This book tells this uniquely American story beginning in 1492 asking whether the course of events over more than five centuries has proven the nations truths or belied them To answer that question Lepore traces the intertwined histories of American politics law journalism and technology from the colonial town meeting to the nineteenthcentury party machine from talk radio to twentyfirstcentury Internet polls from Magna Carta to the Patriot Act from the printing press to Facebook News Along the way Lepores sovereign chronicle is filled with arresting sketches of both wellknown and lesserknown Americans from a parade of presidents and a rogues gallery of political mischief makers to the intrepid leaders of protest movements including Frederick Douglass the famed abolitionist orator William Jennings Bryan the threetime presidential candidate and ultimately tragic populist Pauli Murray the visionary civil rights strategist and Phyllis Schlafly the uncredited architect of modern conservatism Americans are descended from slaves and slave owners from conquerors and the conquered from immigrants and from people who have fought to end immigration A nation born in contradiction

Ireland Interviewing people on both sides of the conflict he transforms the tragic damage and waste of the era into a searing utterly gripping saga  New York Times Book Review Ten Best Books of the YearFrom awardwinning New Yorker staff writer Patrick Radden Keefe a stunning intricate narrative about a notorious killing in Northern Ireland and its devastating repercussionsIn December 1972 Jean McConville a thirtyeightyearold mother of ten was dragged from her Belfast home by masked intruders her children clinging to her legs They never saw her again Her abduction was one of the most notorious episodes of the vicious conflict known as The Troubles Everyone in the neighborhood knew the IRA was responsible But in a climate of fear and paranoia no one would speak of it In 2003 five years after an accord brought an uneasy peace to Northern Ireland a set of human bones was discovered on a beach McConvilles children knew it was their mother when they were told a blue safety pin was attached to the dresswith so many kids she had always kept it handy for diapers or ripped clothesPatrick Radden Keefes mesmerizing book on the bitter conflict in Northern Ireland and its aftermath uses the McConville case as a starting point for the tale of a society wracked by a violent guerrilla war a war whose consequences have never been reckoned with The brutal violence seared not only people like the McConville children but also IRA members embittered by a peace that fell far short of the goal of a united Ireland and left them wondering whether the killings they committed were not justified acts of war but simple murders From radical and impetuous IRA terrorists such as Dolours Price who when she was barely out of her teens was already planting bombs in London and targeting

Thomas Piketty analyzes a unique collection of data from twenty countries ranging as far back as the eighteenth century to uncover key economic and social patterns His findings will transform debate and set the agenda for the next generation of thought about wealth and inequalityPiketty shows that modern economic growth and the diffusion of knowledge have allowed us to avoid inequalities on the apocalyptic scale predicted by Karl Marx But we have not modified the deep structures of capital and inequality as much as we thought in the optimistic decades following World War II The main driver of inequalitythe tendency of returns on capital to exceed the rate of economic growthtoday threatens to generate extreme inequalities that stir discontent and undermine democratic values But economic

finely paced as a novel  Keefe uses McConvilles murder as a prism to tell the history of the Troubles in Northern Ireland Interviewing people on both sides of the conflict he transforms the tragic damage and waste of the era into a searing utterly gripping saga  New York Times Book Review Ten Best Books of the YearFrom awardwinning New Yorker staff writer Patrick Radden Keefe a stunning intricate narrative about a notorious killing in Northern Ireland and its devastating repercussionsIn December 1972 Jean McConville a thirtyeightyearold mother of ten was dragged from her Belfast home by masked intruders her children clinging to her legs They never saw her again Her abduction was one of the most notorious episodes of the vicious conflict known as The Troubles Everyone in the neighborhood knew the IRA was responsible But in a climate of fear and paranoia no one would speak of it In 2003 five years after an accord brought an uneasy peace to Northern Ireland a set of human bones was discovered on a beach McConvilles children knew it was their mother when they were told a blue safety pin was attached to the dresswith so many kids she had always kept it handy for diapers or ripped clothesPatrick Radden Keefes mesmerizing book on the bitter conflict in Northern Ireland and its aftermath uses the McConville case as a starting point for the tale of a society wracked by a violent guerrilla war a war whose consequences have never been reckoned with The brutal violence seared not only people like the McConville children but also IRA members embittered by a peace that fell far short of the goal of a united Ireland and left them wondering whether the killings they committed were not justified acts of war but simple murders From radical and impetuous IRA terrorists such as Dolours Price who when she was barely out of her teens was already planting bombs in London and targeting informers for execution to the ferocious IRA mastermind known as The Dark to the spy

known to identify individual human keepers raid neighboring tanks for food turn off lightbulbs by spouting jets of water plug drains and make daring escapes How is it that a creature with such gifts evolved through an evolutionary lineage so radically distant from our own What does it mean that evolution built minds not once but at least twice The octopus is the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien What can we learn from the encounterIn Other Minds Peter GodfreySmith a distinguished philosopher of science and a skilled scuba diver tells a bold new story of how subjective experience crept into beinghow nature became aware of itself As GodfreySmith stresses it is a story that largely occurs in the ocean where animals first appeared Tracking the minds fitful development GodfreySmith shows how unruly clumps of seaborne cells began living together and became capable of sensing acting and signaling As these primitive organisms became more entangled with others they grew more complicated The first nervous systems evolved probably in ancient relatives of jellyfish later on the cephalopods which began as inconspicuous mollusks abandoned their shells and rose above the ocean floor searching for prey and acquiring the greater intelligence needed to do so Taking an independent route mammals and birds later began their own evolutionary journeysBut what kind of intelligence do cephalopods possess Drawing on the latest scientific research and his own scubadiving adventures GodfreySmith probes the many mysteries that surround the lineage How did the octopus a solitary creature with little social life become so smart What is it like to have eight tentacles that are so packed with neurons that they virtually think for themselves What happens when some octopuses abandon their hermitlike ways and congregate as they do in a unique location off the coast of AustraliaBy tracing the question of inner life back to its roots and comparing human beings with

material Engineering professor Barbara Oakley knows firsthand how it feels to struggle with math She flunked her way through high school math and science courses before enlisting in the army immediately after graduation When she saw how her lack of mathematical and technical savvy severely limited her optionsboth to rise in the military and to explore other careersshe returned to school with a newfound determination to retool her brain to master the very subjects that had given her so much trouble throughout her entire life In A Mind for Numbers Dr Oakley lets us in on the secrets to learning effectivelysecrets that even dedicated and successful students wish theyd known earlier Contrary to popular belief math requires creative as well as analytical thinking Most people think that theres only one way to do a problem when in actuality there are often a number of different solutionsyou just need the creativity to see them For example there are more than three hundred different known proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem In short studying a problem in a laserfocused way until you reach a solution is not an effective way to learn Rather it involves taking the time to step away from a problem and allow the more relaxed and creative part of the brain to take over The learning strategies in this book apply not only to math and science but to any subject in which we struggle We

gripping catandmouse narrative  and an unprecedented view into the twentyfirst centurys signature form of organized crime The word spread through the hacking underground like some unstoppable new virus Someone  some brilliant audacious crook  had just staged a hostile takeover of an online criminal network that siphoned billions of dollars from the US economy The FBI rushed to launch an ambitious undercover operation aimed at tracking down this new kingpin other agencies around the world deployed dozens of moles and double agents Together the cybercops lured numerous unsuspecting hackers into their clutches Yet at every turn their main quarry displayed an uncanny ability to sniff out their snitches and see through their plots The culprit they sought was the most unlikely of

book  as finely paced as a novel  Keefe uses McConvilles murder as a prism to tell the history of the Troubles in Northern Ireland Interviewing people on both sides of the conflict he transforms the tragic damage and waste of the era into a searing utterly gripping saga  New York Times Book Review Ten Best Books of the YearFrom awardwinning New Yorker staff writer Patrick Radden Keefe a stunning intricate narrative about a notorious killing in Northern Ireland and its devastating repercussionsIn December 1972 Jean McConville a thirtyeightyearold mother of ten was dragged from her Belfast home by masked intruders her children clinging to her legs They never saw her again Her abduction was one of the most notorious episodes of the vicious conflict known as The Troubles Everyone in the neighborhood knew the IRA was responsible But in a climate of fear and paranoia no one would speak of it In 2003 five years after an accord brought an uneasy peace to Northern Ireland a set of human bones was discovered on a beach McConvilles children knew it was their mother when they were told a blue safety pin was attached to the dresswith so many kids she had always kept it handy for diapers or ripped clothesPatrick Radden Keefes mesmerizing book on the bitter conflict in Northern Ireland and its aftermath uses the McConville case as a starting point for the tale of a society wracked by a violent guerrilla war a war whose consequences have never been reckoned with The brutal violence seared not only people like the McConville children but also IRA members embittered by a peace that fell far short of the goal of a united Ireland and left them wondering whether the killings they committed were not justified acts of war but simple murders From radical and impetuous IRA terrorists such as Dolours Price who when she was barely out of her teens was already planting bombs in London and targeting informers for execution to the ferocious IRA mastermind known as The Dark to the spy

Ireland Interviewing people on both sides of the conflict he transforms the tragic damage and waste of the era into a searing utterly gripping saga  New York Times Book Review Ten Best Books of the YearFrom awardwinning New Yorker staff writer Patrick Radden Keefe a stunning intricate narrative about a notorious killing in Northern Ireland and its devastating repercussionsIn December 1972 Jean McConville a thirtyeightyearold mother of ten was dragged from her Belfast home by masked intruders her children clinging to her legs They never saw her again Her abduction was one of the most notorious episodes of the vicious conflict known as The Troubles Everyone in the neighborhood knew the IRA was responsible But in a climate of fear and paranoia no one would speak of it In 2003 five years after an accord brought an uneasy peace to Northern Ireland a set of human bones was discovered on a beach McConvilles children knew it was their mother when they were told a blue safety pin was attached to the dresswith so many kids she had always kept it handy for diapers or ripped clothesPatrick Radden Keefes mesmerizing book on the bitter conflict in Northern Ireland and its aftermath uses the McConville case as a starting point for the tale of a society wracked by a violent guerrilla war a war whose consequences have never been reckoned with The brutal violence seared not only people like the McConville children but also IRA members embittered by a peace that fell far short of the goal of a united Ireland and left them wondering whether the killings they committed were not justified acts of war but simple murders From radical and impetuous IRA terrorists such as Dolours Price who when she was barely out of her teens was already planting bombs in London and targeting

a refugee in New York City where he comes to live with his 17yearold cousin Sammy Klayman Joe escaped from Prague with the help of his teacher Kornblum by hiding in a coffin along with the inanimate Golem of Prague leaving the rest of his family including his younger brother Thomas behind Besides having a shared interest in drawing Sammy and Joe share several connections to Jewish stage magician Harry Houdini Joe like comics legend Jim Steranko studied magic and escapology in Prague which aided him in his departure from Europe and Sammy is the son of the Mighty Molecule a strongman on the vaudeville circuitWhen Sammy discovers Joes artistic talent Sammy gets Joe a job as an illustrator for a novelty products company which due to the recent success of Superman is attempting to get into the comicbook business Under the name Sam Clay Sammy starts writing adventure stories with Joe illustrating them and the two recruit several other Brooklyn teenagers to produce Amazing Midget Radio Comics named to promote one of the companys novelty items The pair is at once passionate about their creation optimistic about making money and always nervous about the opinion of their employers The magazine features Sammy and Joes character the Escapist an antifascist superhero who combines traits of among others Captain America Harry Houdini Batman the Phantom and the Scarlet Pimpernel The Escapist becomes tremendously popular but like talent behind Superman the writers and artists of the comic get a minimal share of their publishers revenue Sammy and Joe are slow to realize that they are being exploited as they have private concerns Joe is trying to help his family escape from Nazioccupied Prague and has fallen in love with the bohemian Rosa Saks who has her own artistic aspirations while Clay is battling with his sexual identity and the lackluster progress of his literary careerFor many months after coming to New York Joe is driven almost solely by an intense desire to improve the condition of his family still living under a regime increasingly hostile to their kind This drive shows through in his work which remains for a long time unabashedly antiNazi despite his employers concerns In the meantime he is spending more and more time with Rosa appearing as a magician in the bar mitzvahs of the children of Rosas fathers acquaintances even though he sometimes feels guilty at indulging in these distractions from the primary task of fighting for his family After multiple attempts and considerable monetary sacrifice Joe ultimately fails to get his family to the States his last attempt having resulted in putting his younger brother aboard a ship that sank into the Atlantic Distraught and unaware that Rosa is pregnant with his child Joe enlists in the navy hoping to fight the Germans Instead he is sent to a lonely cold naval base in Antarctica from which he emerges the lone survivor after a series of deaths When he makes it back to New York ashamed to show his face again to Rosa and Sammy he lives and sleeps in a hideout in the Empire State Building known only to a small circle of magicianfriendsMeanwhile Sam battles with his sexuality shown mostly through his relationship with the radio voice of The Escapist Tracy Bacon Bacons moviestar goodlooks initially intimidate Clay but they later fall in love When Tracy is cast as The Escapist in the film version he invites Clay to move to Hollywood with him an offer that Clay accepts But later when Bacon and Clay go to a friends beach house with several other gay men and couples the companys private dinner is broken up by the local police as well as two offduty FBI agents All of the men are arrested except for two who hid under the dinner table one of whom is Clay The FBI agents each claim one of the men and grant them their freedom in return for sexual favors After this episode Clay decides that he cant live with the constant threat of being arrested ridiculed and judged because of his sexuality He does not go with Bacon to the West Coast Some time after Joe leaves Sammy marries Rosa and moves with her to the suburbs where they raise her son Tommy in what outwardly appears to be a typical traditional nuclear familySammy and Rosa cannot hide all their secrets from Tommy however who manages to take private magic lessons in the Empire State Building from Joe for the better part of year without anyone elses knowledge Tommy is instrumental in finally reuniting the Kavalier and Clay duo which works with renewed enthusiasm to find a new creative direction for comics Joe moves into Sammy and Rosas house Shortly afterwards Sammys homosexuality is revealed on public television This further complicates the attempts of Rosa Sammy and Joe to reconstitute a familyMany events in the novel are based on the lives of actual comicbook creators including Jack Kirby to whom the book is dedicated in the afterword Stan Lee Jerry Siegel Joe Shuster Joe Simon Will Eisner and Jim Steranko Other historical figures play minor roles including Salvador Dal Al Smith Orson Welles and Fredric Wertham The novels time span roughly mirrors that of the Golden Age of Comics itself starting from shortly after the debut of Superman and concluding with the Kefauver Senate hearings two events often used to demarcate the era', 'language': 'English', 'genres': ['Fiction', 'Fantasy',

called thempolitical equality natural rights and the sovereignty of the people And it rests too on a fearless dedication to inquiry Lepore argues because selfgovernment depends on it But has the nation and democracy itself delivered on that promise This book tells this uniquely American story beginning in 1492 asking whether the course of events over more than five centuries has proven the nations truths or belied them To answer that question Lepore traces the intertwined histories of American politics law journalism and technology from the colonial town meeting to the nineteenthcentury party machine from talk radio to twentyfirstcentury Internet polls from Magna Carta to the Patriot Act from the printing press to Facebook News Along the way Lepores sovereign chronicle is filled with arresting sketches of both wellknown and lesserknown Americans from a parade of presidents and a rogues gallery of political mischief makers to the intrepid leaders of protest movements including Frederick Douglass the famed abolitionist orator William Jennings Bryan the threetime presidential candidate and ultimately tragic populist Pauli Murray the visionary civil rights strategist and Phyllis Schlafly the uncredited architect of modern conservatism Americans are descended from slaves and slave owners from conquerors and the conquered from immigrants and from people who have fought

ranging as far back as the eighteenth century to uncover key economic and social patterns His findings will transform debate and set the agenda for the next generation of thought about wealth and

it is used perniciously in our own times to chastise presentday movements and obscure contemporary injustice In A More Beautiful and Terrible History awardwinning historian Jeanne Theoharis dissects this national mythmaking teasing apart the accepted stories to show them in a strikingly different light We see Rosa Parks not simply as a bus lady but a lifelong criminal justice activist and radical Martin Luther King Jr as not only challenging Southern sheriffs but Northern liberals too and Coretta Scott King not only as a helpmate but a lifelong economic justice and peace activist who pushed her husbands activism in these directions Moving from the histories we get to the histories we need Theoharis challenges nine key aspects of the fable to reveal the diversity of people especially women and young people who led the movement the work and disruption it took the role of the media and polite racism in maintaining injustice and the immense barriers and repression activists faced Theoharis makes us reckon with the fact that far from being acceptable passive or unified the civil rights movement was unpopular disruptive and courageously persevering Activists embraced an expansive vision of justice  which a majority of Americans opposed and which the federal government feared By showing us the complex reality of the movement the power of its organizing and the beauty and scope of the vision Theoharis proves that there was nothing natural or inevitable about the progress that occurredDust jacket', 'language': 'English', 'genres': []}]"

1638,"[{'bookid': 751, 'title': 'The Art of Computer Programming Volume 1 Fundamental Algorithms', 'publicationyear': 1973, 'description': 'From the Inside FlapCookery is become an arta noble sciencecooks are gentlemenTITUS LIVIUS Ab Urbe Condita XXXIXviRobert Burton Anatomy of Melancholy 1222This book forms a natural sequel to the material on information structures in Chapter 2 of Volume 1 because it adds the concept of linearly ordered data to the other basic structural ideasThe title Sorting and Searching may sound as if this book is only for those systems programmers who are concerned with the preparation of generalpurpose sorting routines or applications to information retrieval But in fact the area of sorting and searching provides an ideal framework for discussing a wide variety of important general issuesHow are good algorithms discovered How can given algorithms and programs be improved How can the efficiency of algorithms be analyzed mathematically How can a person choose rationally between different algorithms for the same task In what senses can algorithms be proved best possible How does the theory of computing interact with practical considerations How can external memories like tapes drums or disks be used efficiently with large databasesIndeed I believe that virtually every important aspect of programming arises somewhere in the context of sorting or searchingThis volume comprises Chapters 5 and 6 of the complete series Chapter 5 is concerned with sorting into order this is a large subject that has been divided chiefly into two parts internal sorting and external sorting There also are supplementary sections which develop auxiliary theories about permutations Section 51 and about optimum techniques for sorting Section 53 Chapter 6 deals with the problem of searching for specified items in tables or files this is subdivided into methods that search sequentially or by comparison of keys or by digital properties or by hashing and then the more difficult problem of secondary key retrieval is considered There searching related to sorting is a surprising amount of interplay between both chapters with strong analogies tying the topics together Two important varieties of information structures are also discussed in addition to those considered in Chapter 2 namely priority queues Section 523 and linear lists represented as balanced trees Section 623Like Volumes 1 and 2 this book includes a lot of material that does not appear in other publications Many people have kindly written to me about their ideas or spoken to me about them and I hope that I have not distorted the material too badly when I have presented it in my own wordsI have not had time to search the patent literature systematically indeed I decry the current tendency to seek patents on algorithms see Section 545 If somebody sends me a copy of a relevant patent not presently cited in this book I will dutifully refer to it in future editions However I want to encourage people to continue the centuriesold mathematical tradition of putting newly discovered algorithms into the public domain There are better ways to earn a living than to prevent other people from making use of ones contributions to computer scienceBefore I retired from teaching I used this book as a text for a students second course in data structures at the juniortograduate level omitting most of the mathematical material I also used the mathematical portions of this book as the basis for graduatelevel courses in the analysis of algorithms emphasizing especially Sections 51 522 63 and 64 A graduatelevel course on concrete computational complexity could also be based on Sections 53 and 544 together with Sections 433 463 and 464 of Volume 2For the most part this book is selfcontained except for occasional discussions relating to the MIX computer explained in Volume 1 Appendix B MIX computer contains a summary of the mathematical notations used some of which are a little different from those found in traditional mathematics books Preface to the Second EditionThis new edition matches the third editions of Volumes 1 and 2 in which I have been able to celebrate the completion of TeX and MF by applying those systems to the publications they were designed forThe conversion to electronic format has given me the opportunity to go over every word of the text and every punctuation mark Ive tried to retain the youthful exuberance of my original sentences while perhaps adding some more mature judgment Dozens of new exercises have been added dozens of old exercises have been given new and improved answers Changes appear everywhere but most significantly in Sections 514 about permutations and tableaux 53 about optimum sorting 549 about disk sorting 622 about entropy 64 about universal hashing and 65 about multidimensional trees and triesThe Art of Computer Programming is however still a work in progress Research on sorting and searching continues to grow at a phenomenal rate Therefore some parts of this book are headed by an under construction icon to apologize for the fact that the material is not uptodate For example if I were teaching an undergraduate class on data structures today I would surely discuss randomized structures such as treaps at some length but at present I am only able to cite the principal papers on the subject and to announce plans for a future Section 625 see page 625 My files are bursting with important material that I plan to include in the final glorious third edition of Volume 3 perhaps 17 years from now But I must finish Volumes 4 and 5 first and I do not want to delay their publication any more than absolutely necessaryI am enormously grateful to the many hundreds of people who have helped me to gather and refine this material during the past 35 years Most of the hard work of preparing the new edition was accomplished by Phyllis Winkler who put the text of the first edition into TeX form by Silvio Levy who edited it extensively and helped to prepare several dozen illustrations and by Jeffrey Oldham who converted more than 250 of the original illustrations to METAPOST format The production staff

American experiment rests on three ideasthese truths  Jefferson called thempolitical equality natural rights and the sovereignty of the people And it rests too on a fearless dedication to inquiry Lepore argues because selfgovernment depends on it But has the nation and democracy itself delivered on that promise This book tells this uniquely American story beginning in 1492 asking whether the course of events over more than five centuries has proven the nations truths or belied them To answer that question Lepore traces the intertwined histories of American politics law journalism and technology from the colonial town meeting to the nineteenthcentury party machine from talk radio to twentyfirstcentury Internet polls from Magna Carta to the Patriot Act from the printing press to Facebook News Along the way Lepores sovereign chronicle is filled with arresting sketches of both wellknown and lesserknown Americans from a parade of presidents and a rogues gallery of political mischief makers to the intrepid leaders of protest movements including Frederick Douglass the famed abolitionist orator William Jennings Bryan the threetime presidential candidate and ultimately tragic populist Pauli Murray the visionary civil rights strategist and Phyllis Schlafly the uncredited architect of modern conservatism Americans are descended from slaves and slave owners from

McConville a thirtyeightyearold mother of ten was dragged from her Belfast home by masked intruders her children clinging to her legs They never saw her again Her abduction was one of the most notorious episodes of the vicious conflict known as The Troubles Everyone in the neighborhood knew the IRA was responsible But in a climate of fear and paranoia no one would speak of it In 2003 five years after an accord brought an uneasy peace to Northern Ireland a set of human bones was discovered on a beach McConvilles children knew it was their mother when they were told a blue safety pin was

justified acts of war but simple murders From radical and impetuous IRA terrorists such as Dolours Price who when she was barely out of her teens was already planting bombs in London and targeting

thirtyeightyearold mother of ten was dragged from her Belfast home by masked intruders her children clinging to her legs They never saw her again Her abduction was one of the most notorious episodes of the vicious conflict known as The Troubles Everyone in the neighborhood knew the IRA was responsible But in a climate of fear and paranoia no one would speak of it In 2003 five years after an

tackling the national obesity epidemicemerge not by chance but by studying and embracing the immediate challenges we encounter every day in our offices and homes laboratories and hospitals classrooms and conference rooms and in all the spaces in between We dont simply realize solutions we design them In this book Tim Brown CEO of the celebrated innovation and design firm IDEO introduces us to design thinking Design is not just about creating elegant objects or beautifying the world around us The best designers match necessity to utility constraint to possibility and need to demand These design thinkers rely on rigorous observations of how we use spaces and the objects and services that occupy them they discover patterns where others see complexity and confusion they synthesize new ideas from seemingly disparate fragments and they convert problems into opportunities Design thinking is a method in which genius in the end is not required Design thinking is valuable not just in socalled creative industries or for people tasked with designing products Rather it is often most powerful when applied to abstract multifaceted problems improving a guest experience at a hotel encouraging bank customers to save more or developing a compelling narrative for a publicservice campaign It has been used by organizations such as Nokia to rethink global gaming and by the Department of Energy to encourage conservation Design thinking is now being applied to address a wide range of issues and concerns from the delivery of clean drinking water in the developing world to improving

simple murders From radical and impetuous IRA terrorists such as Dolours Price who when she was barely out of her teens was already planting bombs in London and targeting informers for execution to
