        "description":"Between 1348 and 1350 Jews throughout Europe were accused of having caused the spread of the Black Death by poisoning the wells from which the entire population drank Hundreds if not thousands were executed from Aragon and southern France into the eastern regions of the Germanspeaking lands But if the wellpoisoning accusations against the Jews during these plague years are the most frequently cited of such cases they were not unique The first major wave of accusations came in France and Aragon in 1321 and it was lepers not Jews who were the initial targets Local authorities and especially municipal councils promoted these charges so as to be able to seize the property of the leprosaria Tzafrir Barzilay contends The allegations eventually expanded to describe an international conspiracy organized by Muslims and only then after months of persecution of the lepers did some nobles of central France implicate the Jews convincing the king to expel them from the realm In Poisoned Wells Barzilay explores the origins of these charges of well poisoning asks how the fear took root and moved across Europe which groups it targeted why it held in certain areas and not others and why it waned in the fifteenth century He argues that many of the social political and environmental factors that fed the rise of the mass poisoning accusations had already appeared during the thirteenth century a period of increased urbanization of criminal poisoning charges and of the proliferation of medical texts on toxins In studying the narratives that were presented to convince officials that certain groups committed well poisoning and the legal and bureaucratic mechanisms that moved rumors into officially accepted and prosecutable crimes Barzilay has written a crucial chapter in the long history of the persecution of European minorities",

                "comment":"pDiana Wynne Jones has been one of my favourite authors since I was a child but this book really highlighted just how much wit she had and how much of it she probably had to hide since shes most well known for her childrens books This book is a parody of the entire fantasy genre pre90s this was published in 1996 with the tone of a very disapproving auntbr br ltblockquotegtiFELLOW TRAVELERS These are people who join the Tour for a short while and then leave or get killed If they have NAMES and characters then you will be sorry to lose them otherwise notiltblockquotegtbr br This book made me laugh out loud with delight but also frequently tempted me to skim A huge negative of the book is in its structure that of an AZ glossary of terms commonly used in fantasy and DWJs hilarious definitions of them Its meant to act as a sort of brochure for you the reader who is also the Tourist of Fantasyland and introduce you to the sights and sounds and people youll meet on your Tourbr br ltblockquotegtiGAY MAGE may be one of your COMPANIONS on the Tour He will be very beautiful and he will dress in gorgeous coloursiltblockquotegtbr br While this is a pretty fun premise it got pretty tiring to read disconnected AZ terms especially when a lot of them refer to another term from a different letter usually denoted with all caps It could also be a function of me reading this on an ereader and therefore unable to flip around like I could with a physical book and perhaps that had been really how DWJ had intended for it to be read As it is though my experience with it just felt very disjointed For examplebr br ltblockquotegtiBaths are the occasion for SEX with one or more of your FELLOW TRAVELLERS No matter how irritating you have found herhim up to then after or during the Bath you will find herhim irresistible It is probably something in the WATERiltblockquotegtbr br I kept thinking about how this book would be so much more fun if it had been sectioned off by themes and categories instead of be alphabets For example a whole section of Worlds or Settings and then another on Peoples and Cultures It could still follow the same premise of being a sort of travel guidebook for Tourists of Fantasyland but having a more coherent line of thought as we go alongbr br However I thoroughly appreciated how much DWJ called out the misogyny that was pretty rampant and typical of the fantasy genre of the timebr br ltblockquotegtiYes it is clear that only males get to visit the human islands and only females find their way to the Dragons This is the tough sexist way the Management wrote the Rulesiltblockquotegtbr br ltblockquotegtiDARK LADY There is never one of theseso see DARK LORD insteadiltblockquotegtbr br This book was also clearly heavily influenced by the Tolkien brand of high fantasy and I felt like a lot of entries were specifically poking fun at Lord of the Rings Im sure DWJ did this in a respectful and affectionate way though seeing that she studied under Tolkien at Oxford when he was in the midst of writing Lord of the Rings I also definitely felt like I could see her tropes applying to other series like Wheel of Time and even the Farseer Trilogy though that is much more recentbr br ltblockquotegtiCurses on RINGS and SWORDS You have problems Rings have to be returned whence they came preferably at over a thousand degrees Centigrade an the Curse means you wont want to do thisiltblockquotegtbr br Nevertheless a great book for any fantasy lovers to check out especially if youre more familiar with traditional fantasy tropes and conventions from pre1990s titles Get a physical copy if youre able to and you might want to save this as a side book to enjoy once in a whilep",
