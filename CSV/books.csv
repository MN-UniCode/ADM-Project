Zibaldone, his 4,500-page intellectual diary-a vast collection of thoughts on philosophy, civilization, literary criticism, linguistics, humankind and its vanities, and other varied topics-remained unpublished until more than a half-century after his death. But shortly before he died, Leopardi began to organize a small, thematic collection of his writings in an attempt to give structure and system to his philosophical musings. Now freshly translated into English by master translator, novelist, and critic Tim Parks, Leopardi's Passions presents 164 entries reflecting the full breadth of human passion. The volume offers a fascinating introduction to Leopardi's arguments and insights, as well as a glimpse of the concerns of thinkers to come, among them Nietzsche, Dostoyevsky, Wittgenstein, Gadda, and Beckett""--",English,[],527

1648270,What We Tried to Bury Grows Here,2024,"A masterly crafted and haunting tale of survival, longing, and empathy, set during the Spanish Civil War. In late 1936, eighteen-year-old Isidro Elejalde leaves his Basque village in Northern Spain, spurred to join the fight to preserve his country's democracy from the insurrectionists by the rousing words of a political essayist. Months earlier, Spanish generals launched a military coup to overthrow Spain's newly elected left-wing government. They assumed the population would welcome the coup, but throughout the country people like Isidro remained loyal to the ideals of democracy, and the Spanish Civil War began in bloody earnest. In Bilbao, Mariana raises her two young children while, with her writing, she decries the fascist-backed coup and their German and Italian allies, imploring the world to support democracy. As the Nationalist forces assault the country, Mariana and Isidro's lives intersect fleetingly, yet in meaningful and lasting ways. Through a chorus of voices--a female soldier in an all-male battalion, a reluctant conscript recently emigrated from Cuba, a young girl whose parents have abandoned her in order to fight against the fascists, among others--we follow Isidro and Mariana as they struggle to maintain their humanity in a country determined to tear itself apart. Julian Zabalbeascoa is a fierce and assured new talent, and What We Tried to Bury Grows Here is a remarkable feat of research and imagination, as well as a transcendent literary accomplishment.",English,[],
482691,A Half-Built Garden,2022,"On a warm March night in 2083, Judy Wallach-Stevens wakes to a warning of unknown pollutants in the Chesapeake Bay. She heads out to check what she expects to be a false alarm--and stumbles upon the first alien visitors to Earth. These aliens have crossed the galaxy to save humanity, convinced that the people of Earth must leave their ecologically-ravaged planet behind and join them among the stars. And if humanity doesn't agree, they may need to be saved by force.The watershed networks aren't ready to give up on Earth. Decades ago, they rose up to exile the last corporations to a few artificial islands, escape the dominance of nation-states, and reorganize humanity around the hope of keeping their world liveable. By sharing the burden of decision-making, they've started to heal the wounded planet. But now corporations, nation-states, and networks all vie to represent humanity to these powerful new beings, and if any one accepts the aliens' offer, Earth may be lost. With everyone's eyes turned skyward, everything hinges on the success of Judy's effort to create understanding, both within and beyond her own species.A literary descendent of Ursula K. Le Guin, Emrys crafts a novel of extraterrestrial diplomacy and urgent climate repair bursting with quiet, tenuous hope and an underlying warmth. A Half-Built Garden depicts a world worth building towards, a humanity worth saving from itself, and an alien community worth entering with open arms. It's not the easiest future to build, but it's one that just might be in reach.",English,"[{'reviewId': 2875234, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2024-03-08', 'userId': 11587}, {'reviewId': 350200, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2022-12-30', 'userId': 1590}, {'reviewId': 806155, 'score': 1, 'comment': None, 'date': '2022-12-02', 'userId': 3392}, {'reviewId': 755721, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2022-07-25', 'userId': 3177}, {'reviewId': 898825, 'score': 5, 'comment': None, 'date': '2023-09-29', 'userId': 3735}, {'reviewId': 1085313, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2023-02-07', 'userId': 4551}, {'reviewId': 1297326, 'score': 3, 'comment': None, 'date': '2023-09-29', 'userId': 5570}, {'reviewId': 1076314, 'score': 4, 'comment': '<p>It’s probably more of a high 3.5.<br /><br />This is another of those arcs of mine which got put on the back burner because I couldn’t focus and could only manage to get to it now coz I got my hands on the audiobook, which was very helpful and I finished listening the whole thing in less than 4 days. But now trying to review it isn’t an easy task. <br /><br />I’m unsure how to categorize this one in ways I understand. It has many characters who have varying motivations and values and methods of dealing with issues, but we also only get one POV which doesn’t lend itself to too much character development. There is exploring of relationships - motherhood and in general, child rearing playing a very important part of this book - and we see how new bonds are made between people of various species with  varied interests, and how this affects the overall fate of the people and the planet/habitat. <br /><br />But it’s also not a completely plot focused novel. It’s a very simple plot point if we think about it - aliens are here who think earth will not survive and want to take all of humanity onto their space habitats (maybe by force) and it’s the turn of various communities on earth who have been working tirelessly to reverse the effects of climate change, to convince them otherwise. How this happens is the plot. But the way the author goes about it involves contemplation, arguments, discussions, consensus building and not any big action set pieces that we would expect from these kind of futuristic novels. <br /><br />Ultimately what remains in our memory after finishing the book is all the concepts that are explored here. There are watershed communities that have been formed around large sustaining rivers who have worked incessantly to bring more ecological balance and reverse the drastic effects of climate change. The technology they use combined with their negotiation methods and how they build consensus to solve methods feels like something to aspire to if we ever want to actually solve problems which are plaguing our world today. We also see corporations and how they’ve created their own world within the world, but I don’t think we got a clearly sense of how their hierarchy and structure works. Their way of treating everything like a game wasn’t something I understood entirely, but I did understand the resentments some of the people living in those lands had against the watersheds. The watersheds ofcourse have their own grievances with the corporations which destroyed the world for their greed. But the author also does an interesting job of giving us mostly clear cut notions of who is ultimately responsible for how close the earth came to collapse, but also the fact that playing a blame game decades later doesn’t help anyone and it’s more necessary to work together. <br /><br />This idea of consensus building is greatly put to the test when our main protagonist and her family have to argue their case in front of the aliens for wanting to stay on earth, confident that the work they’ve put into is helping restore balance to the planet and more can be done with the help of the Ringer’s high tech. The author illustrates the importance of trying to understand each other view points, the necessity of negotiating with even those people who’ve tried to harm you, and how understanding each other’s motivations and goals and helping each other in bettering everyone is the only way to resolve conflict without violence. <br /><br />Ultimately, I felt it was an admirable attempt at creating a hopeful story of building families and communities which will all work together to avert disasters. Its nicely aided by an eccentric cast of characters - both humans and aliens and their respective delightful children - and lots of intense negotiations and conversations. But while I hope that humanity is capable of being this community oriented, the cynic in me thinks it’s unrealistically hopeful and that optimism of it all just made me sad, coz it felt impossible. However, I’m very eager to see what more interesting concepts the author comes up with next in her books.</p>', 'date': '2021-11-04', 'userId': 4533}, {'reviewId': 1873425, 'score': 3, 'comment': None, 'date': '2023-03-01', 'userId': 7890}, {'reviewId': 1165742, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2023-02-21', 'userId': 4960}, {'reviewId': 1551580, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2023-11-16', 'userId': 6604}, {'reviewId': 1667313, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2023-12-31', 'userId': 7051}, {'reviewId': 1789528, 'score': 3, 'comment': None, 'date': '2023-07-08', 'userId': 7488}, {'reviewId': 1956597, 'score': 3, 'comment': None, 'date': '2023-09-11', 'userId': 8533}, {'reviewId': 1484086, 'score': 5, 'comment': '<p>I don’t think of myself as a big sci fi reader or fan. Occasionally I’ll pick something up that has elements that sound appealing to me, but I don’t seek out sci fi on purpose. I picked up A Half Built Garden because the theme of attempting to bring Earth back from the human caused brink of destruction appealed to me, but somehow the description I read failed to mention that there were aliens in this book. I might have steered clear if I had known, but then I would have missed a delightful surprise of a book. Judy Wallach-Stevens is an ecologist with the Chesapeake watershed, in a world which has reorganized itself into networks of watersheds, communities that monitor and tend their local bodies of water and their ecosystems. Decisions are made by technologically assisted consensus, where people share their knowledge to be able to come to decisions that treat humans as part of the ecosystem, but not more important than the ecosystem. The story begins when Judy is making her customary rounds one night and receives an alert that there is a disturbance. When she investigates, she finds an alien ship has landed…and the story takes off from there. <br /><br />A Half-Built Garden has a fully imagined world, where family structure, gender, uses of technology, politics, diplomacy, and ethos with regard to the natural world are addressed. However, you learn about all of these things work as you watch Judy Wallach-Stevens deal with the repercussions of finding an alien spaceship in her watershed, rather than by being told about them explicitly. Ruthanna Emrys immerses her readers in her world skillfully, so that you enjoy the sensation of finding out about child rearing practices in this new world rather than feeling like you’re groping around in an unfamiliar place.<br /><br />Without giving anything more away about the plot, I will also say that this novel also deals with issues of consent, and of people coming in as rescuers when the supposed rescuees don’t think they need to and don’t want to be rescued. I <em>really</em> liked the way Emrys handled this topic.<br /><br />Summary: I wouldn’t have picked this book if I had really known what it was, but I was surprised all the way through by how much I liked it.</p>', 'date': '2022-07-12', 'userId': 6251}, {'reviewId': 2280173, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2023-02-15', 'userId': 9546}, {'reviewId': 2681516, 'score': 5, 'comment': None, 'date': '2023-04-20', 'userId': 10999}, {'reviewId': 1485284, 'score': 3, 'comment': None, 'date': '2024-01-06', 'userId': 1541}, {'reviewId': 3918234, 'score': 3, 'comment': None, 'date': '2023-04-21', 'userId': 15961}, {'reviewId': 4036260, 'score': 2, 'comment': None, 'date': '2023-02-08', 'userId': 16783}, {'reviewId': 5067953, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2022-08-26', 'userId': 22536}, {'reviewId': 5070892, 'score': 2, 'comment': None, 'date': '2022-10-02', 'userId': 22542}, {'reviewId': 5111066, 'score': 5, 'comment': None, 'date': '2024-11-18', 'userId': 22672}]",116273

Gazing out at the shadowy woods, Sandy has no idea that tonight her life will be forever changed. As a late autumn sky darkens over the Adirondack mountains, and the threat of a heavy snowfall looms, the mood in the Tremont house is already charged with tension. Upstairs in her bedroom, teenage Ivy listens to music and broods, while below in the kitchen, Sandy sips coffee and tries not to take her daughter's latest snit personally. But when her husband Ben, a wilderness guide, arrives home, the troubled atmosphere immediately lightens--and Sandy can push all the discord to the back of her mind. Nearby, two desperate men on the run make their way through the fading light, bloodstained and determined to leave no loose ends or witnesses. After nearly two decades as prison cellmates, they have become a deadly team: Harlan the muscle, Nick the mind and will. As they approach a secluded house, its spacious windows revealing a cozy scene within, Nick instinctually knows that here he will find what he's looking for--before disappearing north. When he opens the door to the Tremont home, Nick brings with him a long legacy of terror.

447923,A Contract with God and Other Tenement Stories,1978,"The revolutionary work of graphic storytelling that inspired a new art form. Will Eisner was present at the dawn of comics. In the 1940s, he pushed the boundaries of the medium with his acclaimed weekly comic strip The Spirit, and with the publication of A Contract with God in 1978, he created a new medium altogether: the graphic novel. It was unlike anything seen before, heralding an era when serious cartoonists were liberated from the limiting confines of the comic strip. Eisner’s work was a shining example of what comics could be: as inventive, moving, and complex as any literary art form. Eisner considered himself “a graphic witness reporting on life, death, heartbreak, and the never-ending struggle to prevail.” A Contract with God begins with a gripping tale that mirrors the artist’s real-life tragedy, the death of his daughter. Frimme Hersh, a devout Jew, questions his relationship with God after the loss of his own beloved child. Hersh’s crisis is intertwined with the lives of the other unforgettable denizens of Eisner’s iconic Dropsie Avenue, a fictionalized version of the quintessential New York City street where he came of age at the height of the Depression.

481570,The Cold Commands,2010,"""With The Steel Remains, award-winning science fiction writer Richard K. Morgan turned his talents to sword and sorcery. The result: a genre-busting masterwork hailed as a milestone in contemporary epic fantasy. Now Morgan continues the riveting saga of Ringil Eskiath--Gil, for short--a peerless warrior whose love for other men has made him an outcast and pariah.  Only a select few have earned the right to call Gil friend. One is Egar, the Dragonbane, a fierce Majak fighter who comes to respect a heart as savage and loyal as his own. Another is Archeth, the last remaining daughter of an otherworldly race called the Kiriath, who once used their advanced technology to save the world from the dark magic of the Aldrain--only to depart for reasons as mysterious as their arrival. Yet even Egar and Archeth have learned to fear the doom that clings to their friend like a grim shadow. or the curse of a bitter god.  Now one of the Kiriath's uncanny machine intelligences has fallen from orbit--with a message that humanity faces a grave new danger (or, rather, an ancient one): a creature called the Illwrack Changeling, a boy raised to manhood in the ghostly between-world realm of the Grey Places, home to the Aldrain. A human raised as one of them--and, some say, the lover of one of their greatest warriors--until, in a time lost to legend, he was vanquished. Wrapped in sorcerous slumber, hidden away on an island that drifts between this world and the Grey Places, the Illwrack Changeling is stirring. And when he wakes, the Aldrain will rally to him and return in force--this time without the Kiriath to stop them.  An expedition is outfitted for the long and arduous sea journey to find the lost island of the Illwrack Changeling. Aboard are Gil, Egar, and Archeth: each fleeing from ghosts of the past, each seeking redemption in whatever lies ahead. But redemption doesn't come cheap these days. Nor, for that matter, does survival. Not even for Ringil Eskiath. Or anyone--god or mortal--who would seek to use him as a pawn""--",English,"[{'reviewId': 1349742, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2018-09-03', 'userId': 5814}, {'reviewId': 574296, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2013-06-11', 'userId': 2636}, {'reviewId': 808495, 'score': 3, 'comment': None, 'date': '2011-10-27', 'userId': 3394}, {'reviewId': 764163, 'score': 5, 'comment': None, 'date': '2016-03-01', 'userId': 3217}, {'reviewId': 1188612, 'score': 5, 'comment': None, 'date': '2018-11-14', 'userId': 5107}, {'reviewId': 1614405, 'score': 3, 'comment': None, 'date': '2018-05-02', 'userId': 6874}, {'reviewId': 4653808, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2018-04-13', 'userId': 20498}, {'reviewId': 1638445, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2011-10-27', 'userId': 6978}, {'reviewId': 1588680, 'score': 5, 'comment': None, 'date': '2015-06-30', 'userId': 6787}, {'reviewId': 1806412, 'score': 3, 'comment': None, 'date': '2019-01-13', 'userId': 7472}, {'reviewId': 1712340, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2014-06-07', 'userId': 7194}, {'reviewId': 1675748, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2014-10-10', 'userId': 7096}, {'reviewId': 1959317, 'score': 2, 'comment': '<p>Take any of the many non-descript RPGs of the last 20 years (the games variety, not the tank-busting kind), read its forgettable storyline and there you have it.

Erno Rubik inspires us with what he’s learned in a lifetime of creating, curiosity, and discovery. Erno Rubik was a child when he first became obsessed with puzzles of all kinds. “Puzzles,” he writes, “bring out important qualities in each of us: concentration, curiosity, a sense of play, the eagerness to discover a solution.” To Rubik puzzles aren’t just games—they’re creativity machines. He encourages us to embrace our inner curiosity and find the puzzles that surround us in our everyday lives. “If you are determined, you will solve them,” he writes. Rubik’s own puzzle, the Cube, went on to be solved by millions worldwide for over forty years, become one of the bestselling toys of all time, and to be featured as a global symbol of intelligence and ingenuity. In Cubed, Rubik covers more than just his journey to inventing his eponymous cube. He makes a case for always being an amateur—something he has always considered himself to be. He discusses the inevitability of problems during any act of invention. He reveals what it was like to experience the astonishing worldwide success of an object he made purely for his own play. And he offers what he thinks it means to be a true creator (hint: anyone can do it). Steeped in the wisdom and also the humility of a born inventor, Cubed offers a unique look at the imperfect science of creation.",English,[],6083

176514,Rescue board,,"""America has long been criticized for refusing to give harbor to the Jews of Europe as Hitler and the Nazis closed in. Now a U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum scholar tells the extraordinary story of the War Refugee Board, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's little-known effort late in the war to save the Jews who remained. In January 1944, a young Treasury lawyer named John Pehle accompanied his boss to a meeting with the president. For more than a decade, the Jews of Germany had sought refuge in the United States and had been stymied by Congress's harsh immigration policy. Now the State Department was refusing to authorize relief funds Pehle wanted to use to help Jews escape Nazi territory. At the meeting, Pehle made his best case--and prevailed. Within days, FDR created the War Refugee Board, empowering it to rescue the victims of Nazi persecution, and put John Pehle in charge. Over the next twenty months, Pehle pulled together a team of D.C. pencil pushers, international relief workers, pirates, diplomats, millionaires, confidence men, and rabble-rousers to run operations across four continents and a dozen countries. Together, they tricked the Nazis, forged identity papers, smuggled food into concentration camps, recruited spies, leaked news stories, negotiated ransoms, and funneled millions of dollars into Europe. They bought weapons for the French Resistance and ships to transport Romanian refugees to Palestine. Altogether, they saved tens of thousands of lives. In Rescue Board, U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum scholar Rebecca Erbelding uses unrivaled access to archival materials and fresh interviews with survivors to tell the dramatic unknown story of America's last-ditch effort to save the Jews of Europe""--",English,[],

385054,Down Range,,"In America's battle against al-Qaeda and their allies, the goal of the Navy SEALs is to be the best guns in the fight--stealthy, effective, professional, and lethal. Here for the first time is a SEAL insider's battle history of these Special Operations warriors in the war on terrorism. ""Down range"" is what SEALs in Afghanistan and Iraq call their area of operations. In this new mode of warfare, ""down range"" can refer to anything from tracking roving bands of al-Qaeda on a remote mountain trail in Afghanistan to taking down an armed compound in Tikrit and rousting holdouts from Saddam Hussein's regime. It could mean interdicting insurgents smuggling car-bomb explosives over the Iraqi-Syrian border or silently boarding a freighter on the high seas at night to enforce an embargo. In other words, ""down range"" could be anywhere, anytime, under any conditions. In Down Range, author Dick Couch, himself a former Navy SEAL and CIA case officer, uses his unprecedented access to bring the reader firsthand accounts from the warriors in combat during key missions in Afghanistan and Iraq. Couch creates a pulse-pounding, detailed narrative of the definitive engagements of this war, while painting an unusually intimate portrait of these warriors in the field. The performance of the SEALs in difficult, changing environments--in the heat of the Afghan desert, in the snow-packed Hindu Kush, on the high seas, and in the urban chaos of Baghdad--has been nothing short of extraordinary. The SEALs, coordinating with other American forces, the CIA, and foreign special operations units like the Polish GROM, have once more shown their genius for improvisation and capacity for courageous action in leading the fight against this new and vicious enemy. The first battle history of its kind, Down Range is a riveting close-up of some of America's finest warriors in action against a deadly foe.

The only thing that???s so far kept me from picking up Black Sun Rising, the first COLDFIRE novel, is that I already have a huge stack (I mean hundreds) of audiobooks purchased and ready to read at Audible and on my bookshelves at home. Mostly I collect these when they???re on sale or when publishers send me review copies, so I hoard my precious Audible credits and spend them like a miser.<br /><br />But I just don???t know how much longer I can hold out on COLDFIRE.

That feeling didn’t last long, however. I couldn’t put the book down; it slowly drew you in until I couldn’t stop reading.<br /><br />You get drips of information that slowly help you put together the puzzle of the town. I was honestly surprised at some of the turns, and even the things I suspected managed to take me off guard somehow.<br /><br />The atmosphere and characters are what make this book compelling. The small town with a dark past hanging over it, the feeling of danger right around the corner. And all the characters are captivating – and suspicious.<br /><br />I loved both of the narrators in the book. Odette, a young cop with ties to the town tragedy, and Angel, the young girl Odette is trying to help. I loved both perspectives, and how their connection, though short, had such a lasting impact. <br /><br />Odette lost one of her legs the night Trumanell disappeared, ten years before the book takes place. Her experiences in the book were eye-opening. Her reality is something I know nothing about, and some of her struggles I would never have considered. The same with Angel and her missing eye. <br /><br />This book creeps up on you. The characters get under your skin, and you can’t stop reading because you need to know everyone is okay. <i> We Are All the Same in the Dark</i> will unquestionably be a hit with my patrons.<br /><br /><i>Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for providing this ARC in exchange for an honest review.</i><br /></p>', 'date': '2020-08-07', 'userId': 1714}, {'reviewId': 1355822, 'score': 5, 'comment': None, 'date': '2022-12-23', 'userId': 5863}, {'reviewId': 283342, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2022-08-18', 'userId': 1270}, {'reviewId': 283342, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2022-08-18', 'userId': 1270}, {'reviewId': 282620, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2021-10-02', 'userId': 1267}, {'reviewId': 2043507, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2022-08-01', 'userId': 8915}, {'reviewId': 480679, 'score': 5, 'comment': None, 'date': '2022-08-01', 'userId': 2181}, {'reviewId': 1382642, 'score': 3, 'comment': None, 'date': '2022-06-11', 'userId': 5928}, {'reviewId': 1381697, 'score': 4, 'comment': '<p>Atmospheric and sad but such a great thriller.

And though she sometimes still hears her father’s whispers in her mind, she’s excelling at school, making new friends, and has even attracted an enigmatic admirer. But when her new love interest begins to reveal his more unsavory appetites, Malory finds herself a hapless participant in sick games that force her to confront her nasty inner demons. As the game intensifies, so do the whispers in Malory’s head. Now she must decide: accept the fate she’s always believed inevitable, or risk losing the only person who ever made her feel like she was worth fighting for. But how do you let love in when the only thing that feels right is pain? At times erotic, at times disturbing, and at times both at once, Red Water slithers under your skin with its dark, unflinching examination of the psychology of self-loathing and the secret, unspeakable lust for depravity that lies dormant within us all.

From the HIV crisis to the paedophile priest panic, Woody Allen to Brett Kavanaugh, child pornography to Abu Ghraib, Wypijewski takes the most famous sex panics of the last decades and turns them inside out, weaving what together becomes a searing indictment of modern sexual politics, exposing the myriad ways sex panics and the expansion of the punitive state are intertwined. What emerges is an examination of the multiple ways in which the ever-expanding default language of monsters and victims has contributed to the repressive power of the state. Politics exists in the mess of life. Sex does too, Wypijewski insists, and so must sexual politics, to make any sense at all.",English,[],7890

They feel stuck in lives that look perfect on the outside, yet on the inside, they're unfulfilled, plagued by the nagging feeling that there's got to be more. They feel guilty and ungrateful for feeling trapped in lives that are so good. They disown their pain, or numb it with excessive work, eating, drinking, shopping, social media, or exercising. They search for solutions in books, meditation, yoga, therapy, medication, and workshops, but something is still missing. They wonder: What's wrong with me? Dr. Valerie Rein has worked with hundreds of high-achieving women and discovered that the issues they all struggle with are not just personal--they're rooted in the ancestral and collective trauma experienced by women in the patriarchal world for millennia. In Patriarchy Stress Disorder, Dr. Rein describes how this trauma creates an invisible inner prison, that holds them back from stepping into the full power of their authentic presence, unbridled joy, outrageous success, freedom, and fulfillment. In this book, Dr. Valerie explains: - Why you're dissatisfied in spite of your achievements, and why it's not your fault. - What secretly drains 90 percent of your time and energy, and how to reclaim it. - How to upgrade your game of ""How much can I bear?"" to ""How good can it get?""",English,[],44702

Go inside a disparate group of media and tech companies -- Disney, Apple, AT&T/WarnerMedia, Comcast/NBCUniversal and well-funded startup Quibi – as they scramble to mount multi-billion-dollar challenges to Netflix. After spotting Netflix and the deep-pocketed Amazon Prime Video a decade’s head start, rivals from the tech and start-up realm (Apple, Quibi) and traditional media (Disney, WarnerMedia, NBCUniversal) all decided to move mountains to enter the streaming game. At a cost of billions, each went after their own piece of the market, launching five new services in a seven-month span. And just as the derby was heating up, the coronavirus pandemic arrived, a black-swan event bringing short-term benefits but also stiff challenges. The battle for streaming supremacy may end up having more than one winner, but the cost and disruption to decades-old business models have also produced a lot of losers. Binge Times reveals the true costs of the vision quest as companies are turned inside-out and repeatedly redraw their org charts and strategic plans. Stretching from Silicon Valley to Hollywood to Wall Street, it is a mesmerizing, character-rich tale of hubris and ambition, as the fate of a century-old industry hangs in the balance.",English,[],86

The purpose of tactical magick is to take the magick of survival and incorporate it into our daily lives. So called High Magick is chiefly concerned with expanding consciousness, contacting higher planes, and achieving gnosis. Tactical magick is about learning from the plight of those less fortunate and building upon their techniques to create an eclectic grimoire of daily survival.

It was just SO deliciously British. As always it was also well written and nicely paced. Had an interesting plot. Had likable and (reasonably) well developed characters. I would probably say this was middle of the road in the intensity of the Daddy kink.

I think the overall the plot and the characters could have been a bit more fleshed out. Certain things plotwise were resolved a little too easily. I would have also liked to have seen a bit more relationship buildup between Donna and George. Lastly, not a fan of the ending. We are kind of just left hanging with a tease.

575395,Confronting Dostoevsky's Demons,2010,"Although criticized at one time for its highly tendentious spirit, Dostoevsky's Demons (1871-1872) has proven to be a novel of great polemical vitality. Originally inspired by a minor conspiratorial episode of the late 1860s, well after Dostoevsky's death (1881) the work continued to earn both acclaim and contempt for its scathing caricature of revolutionists driven by destructive, anarchic aims. The text of Demons assumed new meaning in Russian literary culture following the Bolshevik triumph of 1917, when the reestablishment and expansion of centralized state power inevitably revived interest in the radical populist tendencies of Russia's past, in particular the anarchist thought of Dostoevsky's legendary contemporary, Mikhail Bakunin (1814-1876). Confronting Dostoevsky's 'Demons' is the first book to explore the life of Dostoevsky's novel in light of disputes and controversies over Bakunin's troubling legacy in Russia. Contrary to the traditional view, which assumes the obsolescence of Demons throughout much of the Communist period (1917-1991), this book demonstrates that the potential resurgence of Bakuninist thought actually encouraged reassessments of Dostoevsky's novel. By exploring the different ideas and critical strategies that motivated opposing interpretations of the novel in post-revolutionary Russia, Confronting Dostoevsky's 'Demons' reveals how the potential resurrection of Bakunin's anti-authoritarian ethos fostered the return of a politically reactionary novel to the canon of Russian classics.",English,[],

The Unlikely Peace at Cuchumaquic is both an epic story and a cry to the heart of humanity based on the author’s realization that human survival depends on keeping alive the seeds of our “original forgotten spiritual excellence.” Prechtel relates our current state of ecological crisis to the rapid disappearance of biodiversity, indigenous cultures, and shared human values. He demonstrates how real human culture is exterminated when real (not genetically modified) seeds are lost. Like plants that become extinct once their required conditions are no longer met, authentic, unmonetized human cultures can no longer survive in the modern world. To “keep the seeds alive”—both literally and metaphorically—they must be planted, harvested, and replanted, just as human culture must become truly engaging and meaningful to the soul, as necessary as food is to the body. The viable seeds of spirituality and culture that lie dormant within us need to “sprout” into broad daylight to create real sets of cultures welcome on Earth.",English,[],865

Guelzo, America's foremost Civil War scholar, in this moving and sobering oral history. This treasure trove of original documents - many never-before published - creates a uniquely personal, day-by-day eyewitness account of the monumental collision at Gettysburg, in the words of the commanders, soldiers, politicians, and civilians from both the North and the South who experienced firsthand the changing course of the Civil War. Three pivotal days in 1963 - July 1st through July 3rd - marked the beginning of the end of the Civil War. While the audible voices of those who experienced it first-hand in that crossroads town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania have been lost to history, their words live on in Voices from Gettysburg. Gathering a treasure trove of powerful, rare, and haunting original documents, New York Times bestselling author and award-winning historian Allen C. Guelzo presents a uniquely readable and intimate oral history of the Civil War's turning point. We hear from a Union staff officer, a Confederate amputee, artilleryman, a sympathetic Northern woman, a Union prisoner-of-war, Union colonels and Confederate generals, a drummer boy, a fearful college student, those who orchestrated the Battle of Gettysburg, those who survived it, and those who would perish. With introductions from Guelzo, a detailed order of battle, and comprehensive list of every unit that fought, each of these original maps, personal letters, excerpts from forgotten memoirs, and more never-before-published documents offers an unprecedented narrative of the Great Rebellion and the impetus for Lincoln's Gettysburg Address - in the authentic words of fire, blood, and smoke by those who saw the battle, heard its din, trembled in its crash, and struggled with its aftermath.",English,[],2183

I don’t want to give too much away because this is a book best gone into without any spoilers. I will say that it was fantastically well written and paced. It had twists and turns. It had well developed and interesting characters. It was full of multiple POVs that I usually would find jarring but worked well in this instance as they all added a unique perspective to the overall plot. My only complaint is that I thought the ending was a little anti-climatic.<br /><br />Overall though this was a fantastic read and I cannot wait to read the sequel (?)

1703211,An Encyclopaedia of Occultism,1920,"This ""compendium of information on the occult sciences, occult personalities, psychic science, demonology, spiritism, and mysticism"" was one of a kind when it was first published in 1920 and is still considered the best in its field today. Spence organizes a world's worth of magic -- from ""Ab"" (a magical month in the ancient Semitic calendar) to ""Zulu witch-finders"" -- into 2,500 dictionary-style entries that explore concepts and personalities both familiar (Freemasonry, Morgan le Fay) and obscure: palingenesy (a process by which plants or vegetables are destroyed and then ""resurrected""), Leonora Galigai (a 17th-century Italian aristocrat who was burned as a witch). A delight for devotees of the weird and the strange, and a valuable resource for students of mythology and the evolution of scientific thought, this important volume is at home in the libraries of all book lovers. Scottish journalist and folklorist LEWIS SPENCE (1874 -1955) was a Fellow of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, and Vice-President of the Scottish Anthropological and Folklore Society. He published more than 40 works on mythology and the occult, including History of Atlantis, An Introduction to Mythology, and Myth and Ritual in Dance, Game and Rhyme.",English,[],

She decided instead to acquire an education and to participate in the liberation of Egypt from the British occupation. Huda became famous overnight when she led a peaceful walk of veiled women across Cairo in 1919 to free the leaders of the Egyptian resistance who were detained by the British forces. She was then invited by the members of the Bureau of the IAWS (International Alliance for Women s Suffrage) to participate in the international conference in Rome in 1923. Huda became the lifelong friend of Western and other feminist leaders at that conference. It was after this conference in Cairo when she and her two traveling companions removed their face veil upon leaving the train at the railway station and were spontaneously imitated by all the other women in what became a landmark gesture in Egyptian history. In 1923, Huda founded the Egyptian Feminist Union affiliated to the IAWS, and began publishing a French magazine, L Egyptienne, to circulate information about Egypt s plight and achievements under the occupation, and to promote peace between Eastern and Western countries. She soon became - and remained for many years - one of the Vice-Presidents of the International Organization of Women.",English,[],2240

375712,Hot Milk,2015,"A New York Times Notable Book of the Year. Shortlisted for the 2016 Man Booker Prize, Hot Milk moves ""gracefully among pathos, danger, and humor” (The New York Times). I have been sleuthing my mother's symptoms for as long as I can remember. If I see myself as an unwilling detective with a desire for justice, is her illness an unsolved crime? If so, who is the villain and who is the victim? Sofia, a young anthropologist, has spent much of her life trying to solve the mystery of her mother's unexplainable illness. She is frustrated with Rose and her constant complaints, but utterly relieved to be called to abandon her own disappointing fledgling adult life. She and her mother travel to the searing, arid coast of southern Spain to see a famous consultant--their very last chance--in the hope that he might cure her unpredictable limb paralysis. But Dr. Gomez has strange methods that seem to have little to do with physical medicine, and as the treatment progresses, Sofia's mother's illness becomes increasingly baffling. Sofia's role as detective--tracking her mother's symptoms in an attempt to find the secret motivation for her pain--deepens as she discovers her own desires in this transient desert community. Hot Milk is a profound exploration of the sting of sexuality, of unspoken female rage, of myth and modernity, the lure of hypochondria and big pharma, and, above all, the value of experimenting with life; of being curious, bewildered, and vitally alive to the world.",English,"[{'reviewId': 465963, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2017-03-28', 'userId': 2056}, {'reviewId': 846955, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2021-11-05', 'userId': 3600}, {'reviewId': 704484, 'score': 2, 'comment': None, 'date': '2023-01-11', 'userId': 3033}, {'reviewId': 858078, 'score': 3, 'comment': None, 'date': '2016-01-10', 'userId': 3642}, {'reviewId': 764953, 'score': 3, 'comment': None, 'date': '2019-01-30', 'userId': 3222}, {'reviewId': 1341757, 'score': 5, 'comment': None, 'date': '2016-06-27', 'userId': 5778}, {'reviewId': 1855952, 'score': 3, 'comment': None, 'date': '2024-03-02', 'userId': 4322}, {'reviewId': 2093763, 'score': 2, 'comment': None, 'date': '2019-04-08', 'userId': 9038}, {'reviewId': 4671852, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2017-12-30', 'userId': 20616}, {'reviewId': 2129672, 'score': 3, 'comment': None, 'date': '2019-11-24', 'userId': 9161}, {'reviewId': 2535266, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2023-11-28', 'userId': 9685}, {'reviewId': 1378308, 'score': 0, 'comment': None, 'date': '2024-06-17', 'userId': 5884}, {'reviewId': 3472703, 'score': 3, 'comment': None, 'date': '2024-01-08', 'userId': 13857}, {'reviewId': 3838381, 'score': 3, 'comment': None, 'date': '2020-06-04', 'userId': 15693}, {'reviewId': 3846863, 'score': 4, 'comment': '<p>I always love a weird surreal book, and this one definitely fulfilled that for me!

I was left very impressed by their conviction to create worlds which are queer normative, where marginalized people get to be full fledged characters with the color of their skin or sexual/gender orientation is only one part of their identity and where they get to do all the things that usually white cis het characters get to do in science fiction. And the author very well succeeds at that endeavor in this story. <br /><br />Immigration and refugee crisis form the crux of this story - how countries which are built upon the principles of equal rights can forget their roots due to corruption, fear and manipulation; the Carolinia First ideology in the book was too real and scary to contemplate because we see it playing out in front of our eyes everyday; how the inhumane treatment of refugees results in catastrophes and countries end up blaming it back on them, resulting in a vicious cycle that only leads to more abuse and even deaths of refugees. The author also showcases the affects of long term abuse in a very visceral manner, which just made me feel more helpless. <br /><br />I had been trying to read a couple of adult fantasy books but was finding myself not at all able to follow their style of writing, so when I finally decided to pick this up and had reached 30% of the book before I even realized it, I understood why I love YA SFF so much (and also that’s it’s ok to not want to read outside my comfort zone). The writing is easy to follow, the pacing is a bit on the slower side, and while I knew what the endgame was supposed to be, I couldn’t truly understand the big picture. There is a layer of mystery and uncertainty throughout, we are never sure who to trust or who might be the villain, which country is the big bad - and I think the author did an amazing job keeping that suspense till almost the end. The world building is not very expansive but we are able to glean what is necessary for the story from historical documents interspersed between chapters and other small infodumps. We also don’t really get to know all the possible magical abilities and the consequences of using it too much, but I really enjoyed the abilities of the main character. And wow that ending. I found the book very interesting but it was the tension filled last few chapters and that absolutely heartbreaking ending that has made this a favorite. <br /><br />Noam is a survivor - a child of undocumented immigrants who knows what living in poverty means, he lives through his mother’s suicide and his father’s complete catatonic state and ultimately surviving alone during a virus outbreak. Even being accepted into the government’s elite magical training and being the powerful defense minister’s protégée is not enough to make him forget his roots or the anger he feels towards the government which is directly responsible for the inhumane plight of the refugees. His determination to fight for their rights and use all his new found abilities to take down the establishment from the inside  is very admirable. But he is also sixteen, naive and an idealist, justifying to himself that sometimes bad things have to be done for the greater good. He is such a complex character with flaws and we get to know all sides of him, making us want to root for him whole heartedly while also hoping that he doesn’t go down too dark a path. It’s really been a while since I’ve read such a character and I tip off my hat to the author for writing him. <br /><br />I really have no words to describe Dara except maybe a tortured soul. He moves in the world with a carefree mask on his face, only showing his true vulnerable side in little moments, struggling to tell anyone about all the secrets he is protecting, all the while also trying to work on his amazing magical abilities. We never get to read his POV but as a reader we can tell that he is suffering and just want to hold and comfort him somehow. <br /><br />Noam and Dara’s relationship is not something that develops steadily through communication like in other books. It’s depicted in small moments of tenderness, affection, anger, helplessness and everything in between and it was so beautiful to read. Whatever the flaws in each of their characters, they are selfless in their love and I can’t reiterate enough that the ending broke my heart.<br /><br />Lehrer is a fascinating character who I still can’t describe properly without giving away the plot. Just trust me when I say that nothing is at it seems and it was both enjoyable and uncomfortable to read about such a person. There are a few others with magical abilities in the story and while I enjoyed the scenes that Noam or Dara shared with them, no one really left a big impression on me. I really hope we get more fleshed out side characters in the future. <br /><br />To conclude, I already had expectations going into this book but it really surpassed them. If you enjoy character focused YA sci-fi stories with a diverse cast, with a post apocalyptic world that also feels close to our own political reality, a story where you don’t know who to trust - then this book is perfect for you. I’m completely devastated after that end but I also have hope, and because I’m too impatient to wait, I’m going to pick up my arc of the sequel right this moment.</p>', 'date': '2019-09-29', 'userId': 4533}, {'reviewId': 1232520, 'score': 5, 'comment': '<p><i>Finally, to those of you who survived, who are still surviving: I am you.

But last night, I spent 30 minutes explaining to myself all of the problems I had with it, so…<br /><br />Yeah.

I actually <i>did</i> love it, up until page 290 and I started to rethink my entire experience for reasons that I don’t think anyone else has pointed out before me. <b>On one hand, I really really liked the first half of the book. But on the other hand, I’ve never finished a book and had so many negative things to say about it.</b> I could make a list but I would not want to crush the spirits of everyone who gave this book 5 stars. <br /><br />Chai, an ever-fantastic reviewer and blogger, has a great review for this book, and I think it also explains a lot of my feelings, so go read that review, too.<br /><br />___<br /><br /><b>The first half was great.</b> I had very few problems, and I really liked the pacing of getting to know Noam, the other characters, and their world at that point. In those moments, the world building was cool! I liked the science magic. That was interesting. Everything was interesting to me at first! All of the makings of a great book! <br /><br /><b>Noam! I did like him.</b> Nicely-written main character, most of the time. I also liked Dara. Some of the time. Overall, I appreciated these characters and their identities. I appreciated what they represent in the story, Noam as a refugee and both of them as queer POC main characters, teens trying to find their way in a broken world. A lot of the struggles they faced, and especially with Noam because he was The main character, were very real and definitely speak to immigration and general adolescent issues we have today. <br /><br />But it’s… becoming hard to explain anything <i>else</i> I <i>did</i> like about this book, so let’s get into something else. <br /><br /><b>I think my main issue was the writing style.</b> It was the root of most of my problems. It caused me to think too hard about what was going on, and it always felt like I was missing something, a bit of information that was left out or that was implied but not enough. (lol maybe i’m just dumb)<br /><br />There was a <b>scene</b> toward the last third of the book which made me <i>really</i> question what the heck was going on with the writing. Without spoiling anything, Noam accidentally discovers that someone he knows is in a potentially abusive relationship, and his first reaction to finding this out is… off-putting and bizarre, especially considering how upset he is about this discovery a few pages later. In the most non-spoilery way possible, this would be equivalent to someone finding a youtube video of a person in a dangerous situation on the street and saying “that person looks like someone hot I know”. Like… ?????? That’s a completely irrelevant and irrational thought to have??? Upon seeing potential danger???? I reread that scene 10 times and it never once made sense. I’ve read like 15 reviews for this book and no one is mentioning this, either. <br /><br />And after that scene, everything felt a little off to me, and it had almost nothing to do with the previously described scene. The character movements and dialogue were stiff or strangely sudden. <b>Sometimes my mind was just ????? for no good reason.</b> <br /><br />Perhaps I am too sensitive. Perhaps I am too critical. I will accept both of these criticisms, but… I implore you to read that scene I described and <i>not</i> have a problem with it. <br /><br />Anyways! I guess I liked it and I will be reading the second book. <br /><br /><b>tl;dr</b> If I tried to explain to you every single thing I had an issue with, we would be here for a while. I liked it.

Fifty years later, peace and control are maintained by marrying the daughters of the losing side to the sons of the winning group in a yearly ritual. This year, it is my turn. My name is Ivy Westfall, and my mission is simple: to kill the president’s son—my soon-to-be husband—and return the Westfall family to power. But Bishop Lattimer is either a very skilled actor or he’s not the cruel, heartless boy my family warned me to expect. He might even be the one person in this world who truly understands me. But there is no escape from my fate. I am the only one who can restore the Westfall legacy. Because Bishop must die. And I must be the one to kill him...

As the book went on, I started to like him more and more. I actually instantly liked him once he we introduced. I know you’re supposed to hate him because he is the enemy of the narrator, but I could tell instantly by the way he acted, that he was not like his father. That he would win over Ivy and that there was a hidden meaning on why he waited to marry her and not her sister, Callie.  <br /><br />I really enjoyed reading about how Bishop and Ivy got to know each other more each day. How they would open up to each other even though they have no had that ability before this marriage. I could tell that Bishop wanted to get to know her right away. He never resented her for the forced marriage that was put on them like in some other books. Which usually makes it easier for the girl to do her job, but in this case, I think Ivy caved quicker than it would of been if he treated her bad. <br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this book and I would recommend it.

497634,First Women,2017,"“[A] gossipy, but surprisingly deep, look at the women who help and sometimes overshadow their powerful husbands.” — USA Today From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of the groundbreaking backstairs look at the White House, The Residence, comes an intimate, news-making look at the true modern power brokers at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue: the First Ladies, from Jackie Kennedy to Michelle Obama. One of the most underestimated—and challenging—positions in the world, the First Lady of the United States must be many things: an inspiring leader with a forward-thinking agenda of her own; a savvy politician, skilled at navigating the treacherous rapids of Washington; a wife and mother operating under constant scrutiny; and an able CEO responsible for the smooth operation of countless services and special events at the White House. Now, as she did in her smash #1 bestseller The Residence, former White House correspondent Kate Andersen Brower draws on a wide array of untapped, candid sources—from residence staff and social secretaries to friends and political advisers—to tell the stories of the ten remarkable women who have defined that role since 1960. Brower offers new insights into this privileged group of remarkable women, including Jacqueline Kennedy, Lady Bird Johnson, Patricia Nixon, Betty Ford, Rosalynn Carter, Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush, Hillary Clinton, Laura Bush, and Michelle Obama. The stories she shares range from the heartwarming to the shocking and tragic, exploring everything from the first ladies’ political crusades to their rivalries with Washington figures; from their friendships with other first ladies to their public and private relationships with their husbands. She also offers insight as to what Melania Trump might hope to accomplish as First Lady. Candid and illuminating, this first group biography of the modern first ladies provides a revealing look at life upstairs and downstairs at the world’s most powerful address.",English,"[{'reviewId': 720554, 'score': 5, 'comment': None, 'date': '2016-04-08', 'userId': 3076}, {'reviewId': 2074703, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2016-05-17', 'userId': 3441}, {'reviewId': 2199540, 'score': 5, 'comment': None, 'date': '2017-02-27', 'userId': 9302}, {'reviewId': 2770009, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2018-06-25', 'userId': 11268}, {'reviewId': 4076264, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2024-08-13', 'userId': 17253}]",

I’m a man with too many secrets, so the last thing I need is a new roommate with a sexy smile and blue eyes that see right through me. Eight years ago, Roderick left town after high school. We’re not friends. I owe him nothing. But back then, I let one of my secrets slip, and he’s the only one who noticed. Part of me knows I should run far, far away. But the other part wants him to come upstairs and spend the night. But if I let him in, I could lose everything. Seeking: a room to rent in town. I’m tidy, have no pets, and I will feed you homemade bread. I should probably add: Gay AF, and has no filter. It’s no wonder my new landlord is so wary of me. A smarter man would ignore those hot glances from Kieran Shipley. The broody lumberjack wants more from me than another homemade pretzel, but if I push my luck, I’ll end up back on the street. Too bad I’ve never been smart with my heart… Passionate, sexy, and emotional, Roommate brings all the feels and all the delicious heat!

During his reign, imperial governance expanded considerably, and the law was emphasized as the main bond between ruler and subject.

It’s bound by a charm, held together by a centuries-old curse, that protects its members from ever growing older or getting hurt. Emmaline King is drawn to the circus like a moth to a flame...and unwittingly recruited into its folds by a mysterious teen boy whose kiss is as cold as ice. Forced to travel through Texas as the new Girl in the Box, Emmaline is completely trapped. Breaking the curse seems like her only chance at freedom, but with no curse, there’s no charm, either—dooming everyone who calls the Carnival Fantastic home.

Yes, it’s a good representation of the story, but I am not digging the font used or the place of the author’s name. I think the sidebar thing throws the composition off and the author’s name would have looked better under the title and the tagline. I also believe a thicker font would have looked better as well.<br /><br />I really struggled to decide on a rating for this one. I enjoyed it a lot overall. There were a couple of issues that I will address in a bit and one in particular that brought my rating down some. <br /><br />This book was a MUCH heavier book than I anticipated. To be honest by the end, I was mentally drained. It was also VERY well written. Had an interesting plot. Had flawed but likable characters. Alex and Lincoln (from book one) make appearances. It had SMOKIN’ sex scenes. It had angst. It had drama. It had feels. It had a sweet two years in the future epilogue.<br /><br />So what stopped this from being a 5-Star book? It was L-O-N-G. Like epically LONG. Like SO long I though my husband and kids might just find a skeleton holding a tablet when they finally discovered they hadn’t seen me in awhile. Becuase of the length of this one not finding out about Dakota’s secret until 80% was FRUSTRATING. On top of that Dakota doesn’t let Trystan fully in until right at the end of the book. With a book of this length that was just too long IMO.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The second issue and this is where I am going to gently suggest to the author that she add a trigger warning to the blurb. I REALLY didn’t need to know in such graphic details what happened to Dakota. Knowing in the most basic of details was MORE than enough. I had to set the book aside because I was crying and sick to my stomach. When I read a good dark romance, I go in mentally prepared for this type of stuff. This was unexpected. Of course, I had guessed what had taken place early on, but like I said the details were just too much IMO.<br /><br />So overall this was a great read with a lot more depth and complexity than I had anticipated. I thought I was going to get a smokin’ hot sexy read and I got that and SO much more. Two thumbs up from yours truly. <br /><br /><br /><br /></p>', 'date': '2017-04-12', 'userId': 19164}]",77637

745918,How to Calm Your Mind: Finding Presence and Productivity in Anxious Times,2022,"From the author of Hyperfocus, a treasure trove of practical, science-backed strategies that reveal how the key to a less anxious life, and even greater productivity, is a calm state of mind “After rebounding from his own burnout, Bailey devised a clear-eyed, concise method that marries science and self-help; he’s equally proficient in probing the roles of serotonin and endorphins while charting concrete steps in chapters titled ‘The Mindset of More’ and ‘Heights of Stimulation.’ Slow down, breathe, and submerge into these pages.” —Oprah Daily A PENGUIN LIFE BOOK It took an on-stage panic attack for productivity expert Chris Bailey to recognize how critical it is to invest in calm at the same time that we invest in becoming more productive. Productivity advice works—and we need it now more than ever—but it’s just as vital that we develop our capacity for calm. By finding calm and overcoming anxiety, we don’t just feel more comfortable in our own mind—we build a deeper, more expansive reservoir of energy to draw from throughout the day. The pursuit of calm ultimately leads us to become more engaged, focused, and deliberate—while making us more satisfied with our lives. And because calm saves us time by making us more productive, we don’t even need to feel guilty about the time we spend investing in it. How to Calm Your Mind is our crucial guide to achieving calm, navigating anxiety, and staving off burnout. It explains how our digital world drains us, and what we can do to abate the hidden sources of stress that burden our days. Bailey has learned to embrace the analog world and “stimulation fasts,” to use the science of “savoring” to become more focused and present, and to relax without guilt—and he shows us how we can reclaim calm, too. In an anxious world, investing in calm might be the best productivity strategy around.",English,"[{'reviewId': 2964262, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2023-01-25', 'userId': 11822}, {'reviewId': 2362022, 'score': 4, 'comment': '<p>I like the message the author is conveying and I like his non pretentious way of writing.

Nevertheless a great book and it comes at the right time as we all need calm right now.</p>', 'date': '2023-02-25', 'userId': 9602}]",

1496544,Immigrant Student Achievement and Education Policy: Cross-Cultural Approaches,2018,"This book examines immigrant student achievement and education policy across a range of Western nations. It is divided into 3 sections: Part 1 introduces the topic of immigrant student achievement and the performance disadvantage that is consistently reported across a range of international jurisdictions. Part 2 then presents national profiles from scholars in ten countries (England, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Finland, Netherlands, Republic of Ireland, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand). These educational jurisdictions were selected because they represent a range of Western nations engaged in large-scale reform efforts geared towards enhancing their immigrant students’ achievement. Each of the national profiles provides a brief overview of the evolution of the cultural composition of their respective school-aged student population; explains the trajectory of achievement results in non-immigrant and immigrant student groups in relation to both national and international large-scale assessment measures; and discusses the effectiveness of policy responses that have been adopted to close the achievement gap between non-immigrant and immigrant student populations. It also examines the relationships between education policies and immigrant student achievement and discusses how education policies have evolved across various cultural contexts. In conclusion, Part 3 analyzes cross-cultural approaches designed to address the performance disadvantage of immigrant students and proposes future areas of inquiry stemming from the national profiles. The book offers insights into a diverse cross-section of nations and policy approaches to addressing the performance disadvantage.",English,[],832

Edward Dickens, the tenth child of England’s most famous author Charles Dickens, has consistently let his parents down. Unable to apply himself at school and adrift in life, the teenaged boy is sent to Australia in the hopes that he can make something of himself—or at least fail out of the public eye. He soon finds himself in the remote Outback, surrounded by Aboriginals, colonials, ex-convicts, ex-soldiers, and very few women. Determined to prove to his parents and more importantly, himself, that he can succeed in this vast and unfamiliar wilderness, Edward works hard at his new life amidst various livestock, bushrangers, shifty stock agents, and frontier battles. By reimagining the tale of a fascinating yet little-known figure in history, this “roguishly tender coming-of-age story” (Booklist) offers penetrating insights into Colonialism and the fate of Australia’s indigenous people, and a wonderfully intimate portrait of Charles Dickens, as seen through the eyes of his son.",English,[],2096

432830,The Scientist and the Spy,2020,"A riveting true story of industrial espionage in which a Chinese-born scientist is pursued by the U.S. government for trying to steal trade secrets, by a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in nonfiction. In September 2011, sheriff’s deputies in Iowa encountered three ethnic Chinese men near a field where a farmer was growing corn seed under contract with Monsanto. What began as a simple trespassing inquiry mushroomed into a two-year FBI operation in which investigators bugged the men’s rental cars, used a warrant intended for foreign terrorists and spies, and flew surveillance planes over corn country—all in the name of protecting trade secrets of corporate giants Monsanto and DuPont Pioneer. In The Scientist and the Spy, Hvistendahl gives a gripping account of this unusually far-reaching investigation, which pitted a veteran FBI special agent against Florida resident Robert Mo, who after his academic career foundered took a questionable job with the Chinese agricultural company DBN—and became a pawn in a global rivalry. Industrial espionage by Chinese companies lies beneath the United States’ recent trade war with China, and it is one of the top counterintelligence targets of the FBI. But a decade of efforts to stem the problem have been largely ineffective. Through previously unreleased FBI files and her reporting from across the United States and China, Hvistendahl describes a long history of shoddy counterintelligence on China, much of it tinged with racism, and questions the role that corporate influence plays in trade secrets theft cases brought by the U.S. government. The Scientist and the Spy is both an important exploration of the issues at stake and a compelling, involving read.",English,"[{'reviewId': 10229, 'score': 5, 'comment': '', 'date': '2020-07-26', 'userId': 70}, {'reviewId': 1718298, 'score': 3, 'comment': None, 'date': '2021-04-16', 'userId': 7206}, {'reviewId': 5288897, 'score': 3, 'comment': None, 'date': '2021-03-27', 'userId': 23567}]",

242113,"Train Your Mind, Change Your Brain",2008,"Is it really possible to change the structure and function of the brain, and in so doing alter how we think and feel? The answer is a resounding yes. In late 2004, leading Western scientists joined the Dalai Lama at his home in Dharamsala, India, to address this very question--and in the process brought about a revolution in our understanding of the human mind. In this fascinating and far-reaching book, Wall Street Journal science writer Sharon Begley reports on how cutting-edge science and the ancient wisdom of Buddhism have come together to show how we all have the power to literally change our brains by changing our minds. These findings hold exciting implications for personal transformation.For decades, the conventional wisdom of neuroscience held that the hardware of the brain is fixed and immutable--that we are stuck with what we were born with. As Begley shows, however, recent pioneering experiments in neuroplasticity, a new science that investigates whether and how the brain can undergo wholesale change, reveal that the brain is capable not only of altering its structure but also of generating new neurons, even into old age. The brain can adapt, heal, renew itself after trauma, and compensate for disability. Begley documents how this fundamental paradigm shift is transforming both our understanding of the human mind and our approach to deep-seated emotional, cognitive, and behavioral problems. These breakthroughs show that it is possible to reset our happiness meter, regain the use of limbs disabled by stroke, train the mind to break cycles of depression and OCD, and reverse age-related changes in the brain. They also suggest that it is possible to teach and learn compassion, a key step in the Dalai Lama's quest for a more peaceful world. But as we learn from studies performed on Buddhist monks, an important component in changing the brain is to tap the power of mind and, in particular, focused attention. This is the classic Buddhist practice of mindfulness, a technique that has become popular in the West and that is immediately available to everyone.  With her extraordinary gift for making science accessible, meaningful, and compelling, Sharon Begley illuminates a profound shift in our understanding of how the brain and the mind interact. This tremendously hopeful book takes us to the leading edge of a revolution in what it means to be human.From the Hardcover edition.",English,"[{'reviewId': 5704611, 'score': 3, 'comment': None, 'date': '2021-02-20', 'userId': 25702}]",

1648272,Freedom,2024,"The long-awaited memoir by one of the most important political leaders of our time For 16 years, Angela Merkel bore the governmental responsibility for Germany, leading the country through numerous crises and shaping German and international politics and society with her actions and attitude. But Angela Merkel was not born a Chancellor. In her memoirs, co-written with her long-standing political advisor Beate Baumann, she looks back on her life in two German states – 35 years in the GDR (German Democratic Republic), 35 years in reunified Germany. More personally than ever before, she talks about her childhood, youth, and her studies in the GDR, and the dramatic year of 1989, when the Wall fell and her political life began. She shares insights into her meetings and conversations with the world's most powerful leaders and elucidates, with clear and precise examples, significant national, European, and international turning points and how decisions were made that shape our times. Her book offers a unique insight into the inner workings of power – and is a decisive plea for freedom. “What does freedom mean to me? This question has occupied me my entire life. Naturally, politically, because freedom needs democratic conditions, without democracy there is no freedom, no rule of law, no protection of human rights. But this question also occupies me on another level. Freedom, for me, is finding out where my own limits are, and pushing my own limits. Freedom is for me not to stop learning, not to have to stand still but to be allowed to continue, even after leaving politics.” - Angela Merkel",English,[],296

Jo-ann Archibald worked closely with elders and storytellers, who shared both traditional and personal life- experience stories, in order to develop ways of bringing storytelling into educational contexts. Indigenous Storywork is the result of this research and it demonstrates how stories have the power to educate and heal the heart, mind, body, and spirit.

Ember Lee Cardinal has not always been a liar—well, not for anything that counted at least. But her job search is not going well and when her resumé is rejected for the thirty-seventh time, she takes matters into her own hands. She gets “creative” listing her qualifications and answers the ethnicity question on applications with a lie—a half-lie, technically. No one wanted Native American Ember, but white Ember has just landed her dream accounting job on Park Avenue (Oklahoma City, that is).

Accountant Ember thrives in corporate life—and her love life seems to be looking up as well: Danuwoa Colson, the IT guy and fellow Native who caught her eye on her first day, seems to actually be interested in her too. Despite her unease over the no-dating policy at work, they start to see each other secretly, which somehow makes it even hotter? But when they’re caught in a compromising position on a work trip, a scheming colleague blackmails Ember, threatening to expose their relationship. As the manipulation continues to grow, so do Ember’s lies. She must make the hard decision to either stay silent or finally tell the truth, which could cost her everything.",English,"[{'reviewId': 4942014, 'score': 3, 'comment': None, 'date': '2024-09-02', 'userId': 21903}, {'reviewId': 4225130, 'score': 1, 'comment': None, 'date': '2024-08-06', 'userId': 18317}, {'reviewId': 5661591, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2024-03-06', 'userId': 25517}, {'reviewId': 6005652, 'score': 2, 'comment': '<p>I really wanted to love this but I could not get over the FMC’s lying.

185021,The way home,,"""Killed in Action -- the most dreaded words imaginable for a soldier's wife. Jess Albert has been living with them for four years, since the death of her husband in Afghanistan. Finding blessed numbness in routine, she doesn't dare to look ahead, any more than she can bear to look back. Then Tyler Brown, a former special-ops warrior, shows up at her small general store in Minnesota North Woods, jarring her back to life. Jess knows better than to fall in love with another man who places duty to his country before love of his wife- but there's no denying the longing and the hope for a future that Ty makes her feel. A world away, a man ravaged by years of captivity and torture, a man with no memories, finally escapes- clinging to life and sanity in a hostile land. In his darkest hour, he awakes in a lantern-lit cave to find a woman at his side. Dark-haired and dark-eyes, her touch is caring, despite the resentment he hears in her voice and sees on her face. Rabia is bound by honor to save the lost American soldier in her keeping, this broken warrior from a war that has brought so much devastation to her land. But is it honor igniting her compassion for her enemy, or is it something more? While a Black Ops team plans a daring rescue mission to bring the solider home, two women on opposite sides of the world walk a dangerous path between betrayal and honor, and must find for themselves where to draw the lines between duty and love. New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Cindy Gerard's latest novel is a heartwarming, richly emotional, action-packed story about homecomings- just in time for the holidays""--

""Four years ago Jess Albert got the news that her husband Jeff was killed in action in Afghanistan, and a painful void entered her life. The more time passed, the more acutely she felt that emptiness. But when Tyler Brown, former military hero and all-around alpha male, shows up a year after she'd last seen him, Jess gradually begins to realize there is one thing that can make her feel whole again--love. As they're planning their wedding and new life together, Jess receives shocking news: her husband is alive, under the care of a young Afghani woman hiding him from the Taliban. Even as he sees their happily-ever-after slip away, Ty arranges for the One Eyed Jacks and Black Ops, Inc. teams to make a daring and dangerous rescue mission to bring Jeff home. The hardest thing Ty or Jess has ever done is to let the other go. When Jeff returns to Jess, broken physically and emotionally and with no memory of their history, they try to heal their marriage and each other. But as time brings them together more as friends than lovers, an unexpected development helps them see the true way home, to the people they love""--",English,[],

A catastrophe occurs at the pharmaceutical lab in Coventry where sixteen-year-old Wilf is working for the summer. A catastrophe that needs to be covered up at all costs. 2017. Phiney is shocked by the death of her grandfather, Wilf, who has jumped from a railway bridge at a Coventry station. Journalist Mat Torrington is the only witness. Left with a swarm of unanswered questions, Phiney, Mat and Wilf's wife, Dora, begin their own enquiries into Wilf's death. It is soon clear that these two events, sixty years apart, are connected - and that Wilf is not the only casualty. But what is the link? And can they find out before any more lives are lost? A Quiet Contagion is a powerfully disquieting mystery for modern times, inspired by the 1957 Coventry polio epidemic and the 1955 Cutter Incident (one of the worst pharmaceutical disasters in US history - which saw thousands of American children mistakenly infected with a live polio vaccine) as well as the more recent global coronavirus pandemic.

And that’s not me being macho, that’s just me being a protective wife with a tendency toward berserker rage in a given situation.<br /><br />The hero of the story, Imogen, is not quite gaslighted by her friend and sister; but neither woman really ever wants to consider that she’s right about a situation. To their extreme detriment. <br /><br />So, yeah, choices made, made no sense.<br /><br />THAT being said. Because I do not liking camping, this was horror for me. Even before they ran into the villain, I was disturbed and horrified. Even though I grew up in the country on a mountain in a skiing town. I enjoy the details about camping, because I don’t know them, since I don’t like camping. This was a fun read, just not a great read.<br /><br />Seriously, though, Beck is a dolt.<br /><br /><em>edit</em><br /><br />After having my wife read this and discussing it last night when we should have been sleeping, I have dropped the rating down. Absolutely, there seems to be some toxic positivity going on here. And some mental health shaming, which perhaps the author didn’t intend. But clearly, they all need therapy, and Imogen shouldn’t throw away something that helps her cope, like her CBD. But the fact that she WASN’T already in therapy and on medication is ridiculous. She didn’t seem to be broke; but even if she were, surely Pittsburgh has options that are either free or have a sliding scale for payment. And that ending. Woo, that ending. Lying to their significant others after a traumatic experience; not bothering to seek therapy afterwards; hoping that somehow, randomly, the poor dead hiker gets found (they’re lucky he DID); being happy and healthy and besties again? No, nope, no way. Tilda is a trashfire; Beck is a self-righteous, know-it-all; Imogen, the smartest, honestly, feels empowered by killing a person–an asshole, to be sure–but really, she’d probably just be traumatized even more. I don’t buy that ending. If they never spoke again, and the sisters had very strained relations–I’d believe that. If Jamal broke up with Tilda, and Afiya divorced Beck because neither dealt with the trauma, I’d believe that. But I don’t buy that ending.</p>', 'date': '2021-09-27', 'userId': 19290}]",

1538161,How Cancer Crossed the Color Line,2011,"In the course of the 20th century, cancer went from being perceived as a white woman's nemesis to a ""democratic disease"" to a fearsome threat in communities of color. Drawing on film and fiction, on medical and epidemiological evidence, and on patients' accounts, Keith Wailoo tracks this transformation in cancer awareness, revealing how not only awareness, but cancer prevention, treatment, and survival have all been refracted through the lens of race. Spanning more than a century, the book offers a sweeping account of the forces that simultaneously defined cancer as an intensely individualized and personal experience linked to whites, often categorizing people across the color line as racial types lacking similar personal dimensions. Wailoo describes how theories of risk evolved with changes in women's roles, with African-American and new immigrant migration trends, with the growth of federal cancer surveillance, and with diagnostic advances, racial protest, and contemporary health activism. The book examines such powerful and transformative social developments as the mass black migration from rural south to urban north in the 1920s and 1930s, the World War II experience at home and on the war front, and the quest for civil rights and equality in health in the 1950s and '60s. It also explores recent controversies that illuminate the diversity of cancer challenges in America, such as the high cancer rates among privileged women in Marin County, California, the heavy toll of prostate cancer among black men, and the questions about why Vietnamese-American women's cervical cancer rates are so high. A pioneering study, How Cancer Crossed the Color Line gracefully documents how race and gender became central motifs in the birth of cancer awareness, how patterns and perceptions changed over time, and how the ""war on cancer"" continues to be waged along the color line.",English,"[{'reviewId': 4535705, 'score': 5, 'comment': None, 'date': '2022-02-11', 'userId': 19428}]",107

Old friends. Old grudges. One evening back together again. The last time they all had dinner, someone wound up dead. What could go wrong? Sophie Lind hasn’t seen her college friends in a decade when a dinner invitation from one of the friends, Ava, arrives on her doorstep. They used to all be inseparable, meeting for dinner every week, even after graduation. But the last time they all had dinner, ten years ago, someone was dead by the end of the night. It was Sophie’s then-fiancé William who died that night in his apartment, just a room away from the friends he called family. Sophie isn’t sure if it’s curiosity—or guilt—that pushes her to accept Ava’s dinner invitation and unbury those old wounds. When the six friends arrive for the dinner, there’s a small box waiting for each of them by their plates. Each box uncovers secrets that the friends have kept hidden all these years, and with the door to the apartment locked from the outside, it’s clear that Ava didn’t plan this dinner just to reminisce about the past. What happened to William is buried beneath someone’s lies—and nobody’s leaving this dinner table until the truth comes out.",English,[],5038

256915,The making of Americans,,"From the bestselling author of Cultural Literacy, a passionate and cogent argument for reforming the way we teach our children Why, after decades of commissions, reforms, and efforts at innovation, do our schools continue to disappoint us? In this comprehensive and thought-provoking book, educational theorist E. D. Hirsch, Jr. offers a masterful analysis of how American ideas about education have veered off course, what we must do to right them, and most importantly why. He argues that the core problem with American education is that educational theorists, especially in the early grades, have for the past sixty years rejected academic content in favor of ""child-centered"" and ""how-to"" learning theories that are at odds with how children really learn. The result is failing schools and widening inequality, as only children from content-rich (usually better-off) homes can take advantage of the schools' educational methods. Hirsch unabashedly confronts the education establishment, arguing that a content-based curriculum is essential to addressing social and economic inequality. A nationwide, specific, grade-by-grade curriculum established in the early school grades can help fulfill one of America's oldest and most compelling dreams: to give all children, regardless of language, religion, or origins, the opportunity to participate as equals and become competent citizens. Hirsch not only reminds us of these inspiring ideals, he offers an ambitious and specific plan for achieving them.",English,[],

1674007,Happier Endings: A Meditation On Life And Death,2013,"We are all going to die, but some of us will die better. As a spiritual teacher based in the Washington, D.C., area, Erica Brown has attracted a strong following among those looking for practical wisdom based on the world’s most revered and treasured religious texts. Here she shares stories and ref lections on one of life’s most essential topics: how we pack each day with love and meaning precisely because we will not live forever. Erica helps us confront our fears about death—for ourselves and our loved ones—and demonstrates how the last days of life can be among the most inspiring if we learn to leave a legacy of words and values, to forgive and apologize, and to make important decisions about our last hours. Praised by New York Times columnist David Brooks for combining “extreme empathy with extreme tough-mindedness,” Erica Brown is a leading religious scholar with a sense of humor and a gift for storytelling. In Happier Endings, she meets people of all faiths who deal with death in enlightening ways, including a mother who arranged for her children to sprinkle her ashes on a favorite ski slope, an ex-nun who prepares people to die, a group of women who ritually wash the dead, and a family whose grandfather’s Ethical will is read by his survivors each year. Brown leads readers on an emotional journey to prepare for and accept death, drawing on the wisdom found in many spiritual traditions. The crucial step, Brown writes, is becoming comfortable discussing death—and not just in the abstract. This kind of honesty allows for important conversations, from financial wills to last words that reinforce to those you love most what matters most to you. After reading Happier Endings, you will have a greater understanding of what a good death can be and what a life well lived looks like.",English,[],397

Sixteen-year-old Zharie Young is absolutely certain her mother morphed into a zombie before her untimely death, but she can't seem to figure out why. Why her mother died, why her aunt doesn't want her around, why all her dreams seem suddenly, hopelessly out of reach. And why, ever since that day, she's been seeing zombies everywhere. Then Bo moves into her apartment building—tall, skateboard in hand, freckles like stars, and an undeniable charm. Z wants nothing to do with him, but when he transforms into a half zombie right before her eyes, something feels different. He contradicts everything she thought she knew about monsters, and she can't help but wonder if getting to know him might unlock the answers to her mother's death. As Zharie sifts through what's real and what's magic, she discovers a new truth about the world: Love can literally change you—for good or for dead.

1439348,Vikram Sarabhai: A Life,2016,"Vikram Sarabhai (1919-71), the renaissance man of Indian science, thought up the impossible and often made it happen. Founder of India's space programme (ISRO), Vikram dreamed of communication satellites that would educate people at a time when even a modest rocket programme seemed daring; of huge agricultural complexes serviced by atomic power and desalinated sea water. He envisioned research technology that would free Indian industry from foreign dependence, and of a world-class management college that would train managers for the public sector. Between 1947 and 1971, he built a thriving pharmaceutical business, conducted research into cosmic rays, headed the Atomic Energy Commission; set up India's first textile research cooperative, ATIRA, the first market research organization, ORG, the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad (IIM-A) and the dance academy Darpana. Handsome, charismatic, married to pioneering classical dancer Mrinalini Sarabhai and closely associated with the most influential figures of his time—everyone from C.V. Raman and Jawaharlal Nehru to Bruno Rossi, Louis Kahn and John Rockefeller III—Vikram led what seemed like a charmed existence. Yet, his personal life was troubled and his strong resistance to India's move towards a nuclear explosion in the late 1960s put him at odds with powerful lobbies and fellow technologists. In this vivid and intimate account, Amrita Shah delves into the life and mind of a fascinating, complex individual, a multifaceted genius who died young, but whose vision still drives India's ambitious space programme—and continues to inspire India today.",English,"[{'reviewId': 3878964, 'score': 5, 'comment': None, 'date': '2019-03-29', 'userId': 15900}]",1517
1674000,Lost Colony: The Untold Story of China's First Great Victory over the West,2011,"""During the seventeenth century, Holland created the world's most dynamic colonial empire, outcompeting the British and capturing Spanish and Portuguese colonies. Yet, in the Sino-Dutch War--Europe's first war with China--the Dutch met their match in a colorful Chinese warlord named Koxinga. Part samurai, part pirate, he led his generals to victory over the Dutch and captured one of their largest and richest colonies--Taiwan. How did he do it? Examining the strengths and weaknesses of European and Chinese military techniques during the period, Lost Colony provides a balanced new perspective on long-held assumptions about Western power, Chinese might, and the nature of war. It has traditionally been asserted that Europeans of the era possessed more advanced science, technology, and political structures than their Eastern counterparts, but historians have recently contested this view, arguing that many parts of Asia developed on pace with Europe until 1800. While Lost Colony shows that the Dutch did indeed possess a technological edge thanks to the Renaissance fort and the broadside sailing ship, that edge was neutralized by the formidable Chinese military leadership. Thanks to a rich heritage of ancient war wisdom, Koxinga and his generals outfoxed the Dutch at every turn. Exploring a period when the military balance between Europe and China was closer than at any other point in modern history, Lost Colony reassesses an important chapter in world history and offers valuable and surprising lessons for contemporary times.""--Jacket.",English,[],389

1648274,"The Bombing War: Europe, 1939-1945",2013,"The ultimate history of the Blitz and bombing in the Second World War, from Wolfson Prize-winning historian and author Richard Overy The use of massive fleets of bombers to kill and terrorize civilians was an aspect of the Second World War which continues to challenge the idea that Allies specifically fought a 'moral' war. For Britain, bombing became perhaps its principal contribution to the fighting as, night after night, exceptionally brave men flew over occupied Europe destroying its cities. The Bombing War radically overhauls our understanding of the War. It is the first book to examine seriously not just the most well-known parts of the campaign, but the significance of bombing on many other fronts - the German use of bombers on the Eastern Front for example (as well as much newly discovered material on the more familiar 'Blitz' on Britain), or the Allied campaigns against Italian cities. The result is the author's masterpiece - a rich, gripping, picture of the Second World War and the terrible military, technological and ethical issues that relentlessly drove all its participants into an abyss. Reviews: 'Magnificent ... must now be regarded as the standard work on the bombing war ... It is probably the most important book published on the history of he second world war this century' Richard J Evans, Guardian 'Monumental ... this is a major contribution to one of the most controversial aspects of the Second World War ... full of new detail and perspectives ... hugely impressive' James Holland, Literary Review 'This tremendous book does what the war it describes signally failed to do. With a well-thought-out strategy and precision, it delivers maximum force on its objectives ... The result is a masterpiece of the historian's art' The Times 'It is unlikely that a work of this scale, scope and merit will be surpassed' Times Higher Education 'What distinguishes Mr Overy's account of the bombing war from lesser efforts is the wealth of narrative detail and analytical rigour that he brings to bear' Economist 'Excellent ... Overy is never less than an erudite and clear-eyed guide whose research is impeccable and whose conclusions appear sensible and convincing even when they run against the established trends' Financial Times 'Hard to surpass. If you want to know how bombing worked, what it did and what it meant, this is the book to read' Times Literary Supplement About the author: Richard Overy is the author of a series of remarkable books on the Second World War and the wider disasters of the twentieth century. The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia won both the Wolfson Prize for History and the Hessell-Tiltman Prize. He is Professor of History at the University of Exeter.

1703215,Hidden Symbolism of Alchemy and the Occult Arts,1917,"This thoughtful study, which antedates the work of Jung by a generation, represents the first serious attempt to correlate the methods of psychoanalysis with the literature of alchemy and of other great Western mystical and occult traditions. Dr. Silberer was a prominent member of the Vienna School whose untimely death prevented this, his major published work, from receiving the attention it clearly merited. Included is a wealth of material taken directly from alchemical and Rosicrucian sources. Symbolisms of salt, sulphur and mercury; of the prison, the abyss and the grave; of putrefaction and procreation; and of the sun, moon, and planets are carefully analyzed and explained. Passages from the works of Hermes Trismegistus, Flamel, Lacinius, Michael Meier, Paracelsus, and Boehme are cited both as important sources of alchemical doctrine and to substantiate the thesis that alchemy was a spiritual discipline of the highest order, comparable to the Yoga of the East. The entire inquiry is based on a parable from the pages of ""Geheime Figuren der Rosenkreuzer,"" an l8th-century alchemical text. After a general exposition of dream and myth interpretation, Dr. Silberer proceeds to a psychoanalytic interpretation of the parable and then gives a detailed account of the traditions and practices of the alchemists, Rosicrucians, and Freemasons. Returning to the parable, he introduces the problem of dual interpretations; for while the psychoanalytic approach focuses on the depths of the impulsive life, the hermetic and mystical leads to the heights of spirituality. The heart of the book is an attempt to reconcile these divergent philosophies and a meditation on the relationship of introversion to mysticism.",English,[],

259714,The emergence of modern architecture,2003,"""How did Modern Architecture come about as a way of thinking? What were the forces that led to its emergence and evolution? From where did the new desires, values and beliefs, the design methods and building types that make up its cognitive system originate?"" ""In this book Liane Lefaivre and Alexander Tzonis bring together 140 documents spanning a period from the year 1000 to the end of the eighteenth century. They argue that Modern Architectural thinking was created during this period, a wholly new forma mentis for conceiving buildings, landscapes, and cities. The material includes, in addition to the more predictable texts, key extracts from architectural treatises, handbooks, and textbooks, material from letters, articles from the press of the times, scientific memoirs, maxims, poems, plays, and novels. Their authors are equally varied architects, patrons, politicians, artists, poets, scientists, priests, philosophers, and journalists. Some describe and systematize, some argue and criticize, and a large number are eager to present new findings and new ways to construe and construct the world."" ""Through these diverse records, figures, and voices Lefaivre and Tzonis reconstruct a process of complex and perplexing events, conflicts, experiments, and interactions. They uncover that modernism is by its very nature multiple and identify what they call the cognitive 'co-revolution', a web of parallel revolutionary changes occurring in courts, monasteries, palaces, villas, academies, and workshops. This is the story of the replacement over a period of eight centuries of an 'archaic' design mentality, based on myth and ritual, with today's modern forms of reasoning. Marked with contradictions, Modern Architecture emerges making use of rigorous science but also freewheeling fantasy, driven by the desire for efficiency as well as for luxury and aesthetic delight, for adventure of experiences and for critical reflection, for global universality and for regionalist identity, for totalitarian power and for emancipation of the deprived and the oppressed.""--BOOK JACKET.",English,[],

170234,The Dreaming Void,2009,"The year is 3589, fifteen hundred years after Commonwealth forces barely staved off human extinction in a war against the alien Prime. Now an even greater danger has surfaced: a threat to the existence of the universe itself.
At the very heart of the galaxy is the Void, a self-contained microuniverse that cannot be breached, cannot be destroyed, and cannot be stopped as it steadily expands in all directions, consuming everything in its path: planets, stars, civilizations. The Void has existed for untold millions of years. Even the oldest and most technologically advanced of the galaxy’s sentient races, the Raiel, do not know its origin, its makers, or its purpose.

But then Inigo, an astrophysicist studying the Void, begins dreaming of human beings who live within it. Inigo’s dreams reveal a world in which thoughts become actions and dreams become reality. Inside the Void, Inigo sees paradise. Thanks to the gaiafield, a neural entanglement wired into most humans, Inigo’s dreams are shared by hundreds of millions–and a religion, the Living Dream, is born, with Inigo as its prophet. But then he vanishes.

Suddenly there is a new wave of dreams. Dreams broadcast by an unknown Second Dreamer serve as the inspiration for a massive Pilgrimage into the Void. But there is a chance that by attempting to enter the Void, the pilgrims will trigger a catastrophic expansion, an accelerated devourment phase that will swallow up thousands of worlds.

And thus begins a desperate race to find Inigo and the mysterious Second Dreamer. Some seek to prevent the Pilgrimage; others to speed its progress–while within the Void, a supreme entity has turned its gaze, for the first time, outward. . . .",English,[],

Virginia Nazarea now makes a case for preserving cultural memory along with biodiversity. By exploring how indigenous people farm sweet potatoes in Bukidnon, Philippines, she discovers specific ways in which the conservation of genetic resources and the conservation of culture can support each other. Interweaving a wealth of ecological and cognitive data with oral history, Nazarea details a ""memory banking"" protocol for collecting and conserving cultural information to complement the genetic, agronomic, and biochemical characterization of important crops. She shows that memory banking offers significant benefits for local populationsÑnot only the preservation of traditional knowledge but also the maintenance of alternatives to large-scale agricultural development and commercialization. She also compares alternative forms of germplasm conservation conducted by a male-dominated hierarchy with those of an informal network of migrant women. Cultural Memory and Biodiversity establishes valuable guidelines for people who aspire to support community-based in situ conservation of local varieties. Perhaps more important, it shows that the traditional methods of local farmers are often as important as the ""advanced"" methods encouraged by advocates of modernization.",English,[],750

1674012,In the Slender Margin: The Intimate Strangeness of Dying,2014,"""Like Joan Didion's The Year of Magical Thinking, an extraordinarily moving and engaging look at loss and death. Eve Joseph is an award-winning poet who worked for twenty years as a palliative care counselor in a hospice. When she was a young girl, she lost a much older brother, and her experience as a grown woman helping others face death, dying, and grief opens the path for her to recollect and understand his loss in a way she could not as a child. In the Slender Margin is an insider's look at an experience that awaits us all, and that is at once deeply fascinating, frightening, and in modern society shunned. The book is an intimate invitation to consider death and our response to it without fear or morbidity, but rather with wonder and a curious mind. Writing with a poet's precise language and in short meditative chapters leavened with insight, warmth, and occasional humor, Joseph cites her hospice experience as well as the writings of others across generations--from the realms of mythology, psychology, science, religion, history, and literature--to illuminate the many facets of dying and death. Offering examples from cultural traditions, practices, and beliefs from around the world, her book is at once an exploration of the unknowable and a very humane journey through the land of grief.

721411,The Marshall Plan: Dawn of the Cold War,2018,"A polished and masterly work of historical narrative, The Marshall Plan is an instant classic of Cold War literature. With Britain's empire collapsing and Stalin's ascendant, U.S. officials under new Secretary of State George C. Marshall set out to reconstruct western Europe as a bulwark against communist authoritarianism. Their massive, costly, and ambitious undertaking would confront Europeans and Americans alike with a vision at odds with their history and self-conceptions. In the process, they would drive the creation of NATO, the European Union, and a Western identity that continues to shape world events. This is the story behind the birth of the Cold War, and the U.S.-led liberal global order, told with verve, insight, and resonance for today. Bringing to bear fascinating new material from American, Russian, German, and other European archives, Benn Steil's book will forever change how we see the Marshall Plan. Focusing on the critical years 1947 to 1949, Steil's gripping narrative takes us through the seminal episodes that marked the collapse of postwar U.S.-Soviet relations: the Prague coup, the Berlin blockade, and the division of Germany. In each case, Stalin's determination to crush the Marshall Plan and undermine American power in Europe is vividly portrayed. And in a riveting epilogue, Steil shows how the forces which clove Europe in two after the Second World War have reasserted themselves since the collapse of the Soviet Union.",English,[],

The text focuses on inequalities, examining how race and ethnicity, gender, social class, sexual orientation, and age determine our life chances. Each chapter includes a discussion of relevant social policies or programs and highlights how individuals or groups have made a difference in their communities. Although the book looks primarily at the United States, global perspectives are interwoven where appropriate. Pedagogical features and a companion study site provide a platform for discussion that encourages critical thinking about the problems presented. Key Features Retained and New to This Edition Coverage of social inequalities is expanded to five new chapters at the start of the text: New Chapters 2 through 6 (“Social Class and Poverty,” “Race and Ethnicity,” “Gender,” “Sexual Orientation,” and “Age and Aging”) focus on the bases of social inequality and how each contributes to our experience and understanding of social problems. Four theoretical perspectives (including feminism) are include throughout. A new full-color page design and larger trim size allow for better displays of visual content. The book features an improved illustration program, including visual essays now introducing each part of the text, and an expanded photo program, with carefully selected images spread throughout the chapters. The text has an increased focus on globalization, including more comparative theoretical material and examples in the “Taking a World View” boxes. “Voices in the Community” features provide personal stories from people attempting to make a difference in their communities. The new ""What Does It Mean To Me?"" features ask students to personalize the problems and solutions under study. The concluding chapter, “Social Problems and Social Action,” identifies ways in which students can become more involved in helping resolve issues in their own communities. “Internet and Community Exercises” at the end of each chapter include questions or activities that can be completed individually or by small student groups. These exercises take students out of the classroom, away from the textbook, and into their communities!",English,[],

672256,Voice Lessons for Parents,2018,"Presents an essential guide to the art of talking with children that demonstrates how a change of voice can transform conversations and ease parent-child relationships, sharing strategies for communicating with kids at different age levels.

""Most parents are perfectly fine communicators--unless they're talking to their children. Then, too often, their pitch rises and they come across as pleading, indignant, wounded, outraged. In tone and body language they signal, 'I can't handle it when you act like a child.' Dr. Wendy Mogel saw this pattern time and again in her clinical practice. In response she developed a remarkably effective series of 'voice lessons,' which she shared with parents who were struggling with their kids. The results were immediate: a shift in vocal style led to children who were calmer, listened more attentively, and communicated with more warmth, respect, and sincerity. In [this book], Mogel elaborates on her novel clinical approach, revealing how each age and stage of a child's life brings new opportunities to connect through language. Drawing from sources as diverse as neuroscience, fairy tales, and anthropology, Mogel offers specific guidance for talking to children across the expanse of childhood and adolescence. She also explains the best ways to talk about your child to partners, exes, and grandparents, as well as to teachers, coaches, and caretakers. Throughout the book, Mogel addresses an obstacle that bedevils even the most seasoned and confident parent: the distraction of digital devices, how they impact our connection with our families, and what we can do about it. Mogel's now classic book, The Blessing of a Skinned Knee, is a beloved resource for a generation of parents. Voice Lessons for Parents brings her unique brand of practical wisdom to harried parents eager to deepen their relationships with their kids. 'Children will lead you on an incredible journey,' writes Mogel, 'if they trust you, if you take the time, and if you're willing to follow.'""--Dust jacket.",English,"[{'reviewId': 523185, 'score': 5, 'comment': None, 'date': '2020-07-01', 'userId': 2335}]",

443237,The New Climate War,2021,"Shortlisted for the FT/McKinsey Business Book of the Year award A renowned climate scientist shows how fossil fuel companies have waged a thirty-year campaign to deflect blame and responsibility and delay action on climate change, and offers a battle plan for how we can save the planet. Recycle. Fly less. Eat less meat. These are some of the ways that we've been told can slow climate change. But the inordinate emphasis on individual behavior is the result of a marketing campaign that has succeeded in placing the responsibility for fixing climate change squarely on the shoulders of individuals. Fossil fuel companies have followed the example of other industries deflecting blame (think ""guns don't kill people, people kill people"") or greenwashing (think of the beverage industry's ""Crying Indian"" commercials of the 1970s). Meanwhile, they've blocked efforts to regulate or price carbon emissions, run PR campaigns aimed at discrediting viable alternatives, and have abdicated their responsibility in fixing the problem they've created. The result has been disastrous for our planet. In The New Climate War, Mann argues that all is not lost. He draws the battle lines between the people and the polluters-fossil fuel companies, right-wing plutocrats, and petrostates. And he outlines a plan for forcing our governments and corporations to wake up and make real change, including: A common-sense, attainable approach to carbon pricing- and a revision of the well-intentioned but flawed currently proposed version of the Green New Deal; Allowing renewable energy to compete fairly against fossil fuels Debunking the false narratives and arguments that have worked their way into the climate debate and driven a wedge between even those who support climate change solutions Combatting climate doomism and despair-mongering With immensely powerful vested interests aligned in defense of the fossil fuel status quo, the societal tipping point won't happen without the active participation of citizens everywhere aiding in the collective push forward.

The editors and several of the authors write from practical field experience in nonproliferation and counterterrorism efforts. Others have had significant responsibility for developing government policies to address the threat of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism. The contributors include a majority of the significant names in the field including Bruce Hoffman, Brian Jenkins, Jonathan Tucker, Rohan Gunaratna, David Franz, Richard Betts, William Rosenau, and David Albright.
Unit One of the book introduces key terms and addresses important strategic and policy debates. Authors explain how the new forms of terrorism affect the post-9/11 security environment and introduce the notion that weapons of mass destruction could give terrorists short-term, asymmetric attack advantages over conventional military forces. Unit Two offers detailed accounts of the characteristics, availability, and dangers of specific types of WMD, along with four case studies that associate theory with practice—an important feature of this volume. Unit Three deals with past, present, and future national and international responses to—and defenses against—the threat of WMD terrorism.

1012650,Telling About Society,2007,"I Remember, one of French writer Georges Perec’s most famous pieces, consists of 480 numbered paragraphs—each just a few short lines recalling a memory from his childhood. The work has neither a beginning nor an end. Nor does it contain any analysis. But it nonetheless reveals profound truths about French society during the 1940s and 50s. Taking Perec’s book as its cue, Telling About Society explores the unconventional ways we communicate what we know about society to others. The third in distinguished teacher Howard Becker’s best-selling series of writing guides for social scientists, the book explores the many ways knowledge about society can be shared and interpreted through different forms of telling—fiction, films, photographs, maps, even mathematical models—many of which remain outside the boundaries of conventional social science. Eight case studies, including the photographs of Walker Evans, the plays of George Bernard Shaw, the novels of Jane Austen and Italo Calvino, and the sociology of Erving Goffman, provide convincing support for Becker’s argument: that every way of telling about society is perfect—for some purpose. The trick is, as Becker notes, to discover what purpose is served by doing it this way rather than that. With Becker’s trademark humor and eminently practical advice, Telling About Society is an ideal guide for social scientists in all fields, for artists interested in saying something about society, and for anyone interested in communicating knowledge in unconventional ways.",English,[],

A heart-wrenching portrait of family crisis, this is perfect for fans of Laurie Halse Anderson’s Speak and Jay Asher’s Thirteen Reasons Why. For Matt and his sisters, life with their cruel, physically abusive mother is a day-to-day struggle for survival. But then Matt witnesses a man named Murdoch coming to a child’s rescue in a convenience store; and for the first time, he feels a glimmer of hope. Then, amazingly, Murdoch begins dating Matt’s mother. Life is suddenly almost good. But the relief lasts only a short time. When Murdoch inevitable breaks up with their mother, Matt knows that he’ll need to take some action. Can he call upon Murdoch to be his hero? Or will Matt have to take measures into his own hands?

1565061,What the Best Law Teachers Do,2013,"What makes a great law professor? The first study of its kind, What the Best Law Teachers Do identifies the methods, strategies, and personal traits of professors whose students achieve exceptional learning. This pioneering book will be of interest to any instructor seeking concrete, proven techniques for helping students succeed. What the Best Law Teachers Do introduces readers to twenty-six professors from law schools across the United States. These instructors are renowned for their exacting standards: they set expectations high, while also making course requirements--and their belief that their students can meet them--clear from the outset. They demonstrate professional behavior and tell students to approach class as they would their future professional life: by being as prepared, polished, and gracious as possible. And they prepare themselves for class in depth, even when they have taught the course for years. The best law professors understand that the little things matter. They start class on time and stay afterward to answer questions. They learn their students' names and respond promptly to emails. These instructors are all tough--but they are also committed, creative, and compassionate mentors. With its close-to-the-ground accounts of exceptional educators in action, What the Best Law Teachers Do offers insights into effective pedagogy that transcend the boundaries of legal education.",English,[],817

Her art is technically fantastic and really striking, but that precision gives it a layer of remove and coldness that is also true in the story. This book seemed to want to be three things at once and none of them were fully realized: an exploration of her own relationship to her parents/childhood, an exploration of her father's history and what radicalized and ultimately killed him, AND an explanation of former Yugoslovian (Serbian/Croation specifically) history and conflict through the lens of her family. The sections are disjointed and lose momentum (but gain lots of text) when she takes you outside of her family history to explain the country history.

I had to remind myself that these conversations were (presumably, though never explicitly stated) taking place in Serbo-Croatian.

I read along, enjoying, thinking. “Okay, what bonkers thing is going to happen next,” and then another bonkers thing would happen. I found it very VC Andrews Flowers in the Attic in tone, a bit more soap operaesque, meant to be engaging, but not literary or deep. <br /><br />Mercy, the main character, is pretty simple in doing what it takes to survive. There are no scenes where she thinks or analyzes. The writing heavily favors telling over showing. I think the story would have had a whole different tone and a different level of engagement for me if Mercy would have been more proactive, instead of waiting for the bad thing to happen before making her next move. <br /><br />The last portion of the book, however, seemed deeper, started to make me care and engage more, as the book felt like it had a theme, a message, and Mercy seemed to experience growth. One of the things I would say about the series that began with Flowers in the Attic is that Cathy never really matured from the child she was in the very beginning, never really operated as an adult. Mercy was similar for most of the book, and then she took steps to become more. <br /><br />And so toward the end, I though, okay, it’s about sisterhood, not just the biological kind, but the female relationships we choose for ourselves – wow, I like that. But everything that came before only lightly hinted at that. If this book at been operating at this level, both in terms of the sisterhood angle and in terms of feminist commentary on the men she encounters – whew! <br /><br />4 stars because I always liked this book, and it would be 4 stars even if that last portion didn’t become more layered, because it was entertaining. I LOVED Flowers in the Attic, after all.

It felt like a combination of reality TV shows like Selling Sunset and mystery books like Big Little Lies. <br /><br />The story is centered around Jenny, a successful salon owner, and 4 of her very rich clients. I liked that all of the characters brought something a little different to the table. Ruthless Olivia, lost Shannon, naïve Crystal, pragmatic Kate and peacekeeper Jenny. Not to say they’re one dimensional characters. In fact, throughout the book we see different sides of each of them. <br /><br />The main focus of the story is the relationship between these characters rather than the mystery. And the relationships, with years of secrets and resentments, is filled with cattiness, snark, and figurative backstabbing. A lot of times it really reminded me of watching reality TV. <br /><br />For most of the book the only thing we know is that one of them is dead, but all the way to the reveal, the book had me guessing on who was gonna be murdered and by whom. <br /><br />If you enjoy flawed characters, this books has plenty. I liked they all got their own POV, so we could see what their motivations were from their own perspective. Since not all of them are likeable, (there was one I especially loved to hate) seeing their side of things helped. <br /><br />This book does a great job of keeping the drama intriguing and engaging.

My anger started around page 38 and never abated. You see, Seanan McGuire values representation. She does not apparently value <i>correctly</i> representing people. When the protagonist complained that she had not developed breasts and was short, I assumed we were getting some Turner Syndrome representation – you know, a syndrome, that results in delayed puberty and short stature. When instead, McGuire declared her protagonist to have CAIS (complete androgen insensitivity) I was confused. It had been a while since I’d taken my general genetics boards but it took me only 30 seconds on google to confirm: girls with CAIS have normal breast development and normal height velocity with a normal age of maximum height velocity (growth spurt). I kept reading – maybe the protagonist had a secret gonadectomy to explain those features? Maybe the mother was confused? But no explanation was forthcoming and it dawned on me: I don’t think McGuire actually ever spoke to anyone with CAIS. And the more I thought about that, the more it upset me: McGuire refers to Regan multiple times as being “intersex,” a term that many women in the CAIS community don’t use to refer to themselves. I had originally felt okay with Regan reclaiming the term, but the more I thought about McGuire using it with apparently no community input the less good I felt about it. And I thought about how McGuire portrays herself as a champion of diversity and the harm caused by tokenism rather than true representation. This is not doing it right. Do better. Talk to people with disorders of sexual development and ask how they’d like to be portrayed. At the very least, do a five minute google search.

In reading her stories, it seems like McGuire takes tales of old and twists them, turns them on their head, and serves them to her readers like an exquisite delicacy. I have gorged myself on her stories in the past. I can say that I have enjoyed what Seanan has written for her full catalog in one way or another. Even the stories that don’t 100% connect with me as a reader, I appreciate her mastery as a writer. Luckily for me, she is a prolific writer, and I have many choices in stories. <br /><br />All that being said, I enjoyed Across the Green Grass Fields, as I have enjoyed or loved the other books in her Wayward Children series, but this one was not my favorite. I came out of the story almost ambivalent to the plot. <br /><br />The story starts with the main character, a little girl named Regan. Regan is different than other girls in the story. You see how Regan is kind and empathetic and how she stumbles in personal relationships as McGuire details the intricacies of those relationships with her peers. Girls can be mean, the mean girl stereotype is there for a reason, and she is getting the full force of it due to her “best friend.”  While Regan is ten at the start of this story, that is only in years as Regan is far wiser in some ways than your average ten-year-old girl. Regan has one passion, and that is a love of horses. According to Regan, this is an acceptable passion for a young girl. Had she had a passion, for say, bugs, she knows that she would be ostracized and shunned as some of her classmates had been. She keeps most of this love to herself and does not share it with her schoolmates. This self-awareness plays a significant role in Regan’s character’s development as the story moves onwards. <br /><br />As the story continues, Regan ages, and her schoolmates physically develop. But, Regan seems stalled in her childlike stage. She is standing on the precipice of starting that terrible transition to adulthood but not quite getting there. <br /><br />She goes to her parents with the question, “Why?” Why is she different than the other girls? Her parents let her know that she is intersex. I am delighted that McGuire took such a real and pertinent issue and gave it the treatment it deserves. Regan is an example of one of McGuire’s strengths, in that she treats and creates children as real human beings. They feel fear, panic, and emotional turmoil and are not treated with, pardon the pun, kid gloves. <br /><br />Regan reaches out to a “friend” and explains to her friend what being intersex is. She wants to talk about a momentous thing in her life so she reaches out to a “friend.” The “friend” reacts as I can imagine some children reacting and starts yelling at her, calling her a boy and telling the school. What should be an intimate moment between friends turns into taunting and jeers from uninformed and cruel kids. Regan runs out of her school. <br /><br />At this point, Regan finds a door. <br /><br />If you are familiar with any of the Wayward Children books, you understand the significance of a door and what it means for the child. The door is to a place, unlike your home. In previous books, a door led children to a land of mad science and death, a goblin market, or lands made of candy. Each land changes the child. In this child’s case, the land that Regan walked into is one called Hooflands. A land of centaurs, unicorns, and other creatures of the same ilk. Perfect land for one who loves all creatures equine. It is said when a human child comes through a door into the Hooflands; it portends to change. By the act of her coming to The Hooflands, her human nature wills a destiny into effect. One that will affect the citizens of The Hooflands and change the world they know. Regan does not believe in destiny. <br /><br />“Welcome to the Hooflands. We’re happy to have you, even if you being here means something’s coming.”<br /><br />The second and third part of Across the Grass Green Fields details the land of centaurs and unicorns. It is an unusual lake on the mythos behind these creatures. McGuire’s Worldbuilding is lush and verdant. Like any of her other stories across multiple genres, there is always a slightly dark edge to everything. What may be green and gorgeous with towering trees and emerald green moss will likely be housing monsters. This speaks to McGuire’s familiarity with folk tales and legends. Before Disney, stories such as The Little Mermaid and Hansel and Gretel were tales of fancy as much as cautionary. Good does not always conquer evil. Sometimes the witch does eat the children, and the mermaid might not get the prince. And, of course, everything has teeth. <br /><br />Regan spends years living amongst the creatures of The Hooflands. She becomes a wild girl, probably who she was always meant to be. She also learns self-reliance, kindness, strength of will, and character. I like who Regan becomes; it feels like a proper extension and growth for her as a character. But, as a human is an omen for significant change in the Hooflands, Regan has a destiny that will be fulfilled. Even if she doesn’t believe in fate and wants to be left alone with her found family.<br /><br />“She still didn’t believe in destiny. Clay shaped into a cup was not always destined to become a drinking vessel’ it was simply shaped by someone too large to be resisted. She was not clay, but she had been shaped by her circumstances all the same, not directed by any destiny.”<br /><br />The fourth and final act of the story is where Across the Green Grass Fields lost me a little bit. This book has beautiful writing, a great explanation of centaurs’ matriarchal society, and touching descriptions of the real friendships Regan makes. But, beyond the lush details, the actual plot and final crescendo of the story fell flat for me. It felt anti-climatic in the face of such excellent writing. However, I have to say that Regan’s very practical nature is entertaining to read. The vital thing to note about the ending, even though I found it anti-climatic; it is in line with Regan’s character. One of the major themes of Across the Green Grass Fields has to do with destiny or lack thereof. Regan believes in her future, her own path. It will not be defined by what and who thinks it should. That idea starts slow when dealing with her peers’ preconceived notions and eventually crescendos at the end of the story.  Regan becomes more comfortable in her shoes and does not care if that bothers anyone. <br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this addition to The Wayward Children series, great characters, and a lush world.  It is solid, but I think it lacks the same oomph that other books in the series have. I will continue reading the Wayward Books, taken as a whole series; they are lovely and some of McGuires best writing.</p>', 'date': '2020-10-15', 'userId': 5961}, {'reviewId': 1804348, 'score': 5, 'comment': None, 'date': '2021-02-13', 'userId': 6919}, {'reviewId': 4056726, 'score': 3, 'comment': None, 'date': '2024-09-05', 'userId': 16895}, {'reviewId': 1609734, 'score': 5, 'comment': None, 'date': '2022-12-22', 'userId': 6865}, {'reviewId': 2050949, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2021-02-07', 'userId': 8935}, {'reviewId': 2781399, 'score': 3, 'comment': None, 'date': '2020-06-10', 'userId': 11302}, {'reviewId': 2043788, 'score': 5, 'comment': None, 'date': '2021-09-04', 'userId': 8915}, {'reviewId': 1233530, 'score': 4, 'comment': '<p>One of the better Wayward Children books!

Unknowingly she enters and finds herself in the Hooflands. A world where equine creatures such as centaurs and unicorns are its inhabitants. With her love for horses, Regan feels at home as she settles in with a family of centaur herders. But all humans who enter the Hooflands are pulled by destiny to save it. And dark secrets are lurking in the land.\n\nAcross the Green Grass Fields is not as dark as previous Wayward Children books. But that doesn’t mean the story isn’t as good. The central theme of the series remains the same. Children find doors to other worlds when they feel they are no longer accepted in our world. What may throw a few readers is the brand new character, Regan, who is introduced. This one is set as a standalone novel, so none of the characters readers have come to know throughout the series will be present.\n\nSeanan McGuire always tackles unique subjects in the Wayward Children series. This time Regan is put out by her friends after sharing a secret about herself. (To avoid spoilers, you’ll have to read the book to find out what exactly that secret is.) And unfortunately, because Regan is different from the other girls, once this secret has been told, the whispers and mean gossip begins. Feeling ostracized she leaves school. And so the door to the Hooflands appears, allowing her into a world that will accept Regan for who she is despite her differences.\n\nEach new story in the Wayward Children is as heartbreaking as it is captivating.

Walking home from school after a rough day of bad choices, she finds a strange door and stumbles into another world, a world populated by various equine races. Her presence means their world needs saving, but Regan doesn’t believe in destiny, and doesn’t want to be a hero.<br /><br />This is the 6th book in the Wayward Children series, but is a complete standalone novella. Regan has not been in any of the other books and the story is completely self-contained.<br /><br />I loved Regan as a character and enjoyed seeing her start to question the world and her place in it. I thought the Hooflands were wonderful, with a well developed culture between the various hooved races (which includes centaurs, kelpies, satyrs and more).<br /><br />While I’d have liked a longer epilogue showing some of the fallout of Regan’s adventure I understand why McGuire ended this novella where she did. It wraps up this particular story nicely, though I’m hopeful there’s a follow-up novella that continues Regan’s story.<br /><br />The copy of the book I reviewed was an advance reader copy, so it didn’t have the illustrations by Rovina Cai. I’ve seen a few of them on the Tor.com website (www.tor.com/2020/11/17/rovina-cai-illustrates-across-the-green-grass-fields-by-seanan-mcguire/) and they’re quite nice and I can imagine they help add to the fairytale quality of the story.<br /><br />If you love horses and character development, this one’s for you.</p>', 'date': '2020-12-02', 'userId': 319}, {'reviewId': 2661707, 'score': 5, 'comment': '<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>5 stars</td>\n      <td>ah!

Maybe that was why the shape in the nearby growth caught her eye, and she stopped abruptly, sending a pebble clattering into the creek as she cocked her head and blinked at what was surely a trick of the light.<br /><br />Two trees had grown around each other, branches tangling and twisting like the wicker of a basket. They looped in and out of one another’s embrace, until they formed what looked almost like a doorway. That was interesting, but not unique; branches often grew together, and the shapes they made in the process could be remarkably architectural. She’d seen castles in the trees when she was little, castles and dragons and all manner of fabulous things.<br /><br />But she’d never seen a doorway before.&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br /><br />WHAT’S <i>ACROSS THE GREEN GRASS FIELDS</i> ABOUT? <br />Regan is ten-years-old when she finds this doorway, but we meet her when she’s a little younger. We see her making regrettable, entirely predictable (and understandable) mistakes when it comes to friendship, the kind of mistakes that shape her social future in ways she can’t imagine. We readers cringe, hope she’d make better choices, and then just wait to see how bad the damage is going to be when she realizes (probably too late) that she’s befriended and trusted the wrong sort of person. Other than that mistake, she seems like a sweet girl, she loves horses and riding, her family, and her friend.<br /><br />The day after she learns something devastating from her parents, she learns that lesson about trust the hard way and runs away from school into the less-developed area between her school and home.<br /><br />As children do in this series, she walks through that doorway and finds herself in a new world. The first person she meets (a centaur) tells her it’s called The Hoooflands. And she is <i>excited</i> to find a human. Humans arrive in The Hooflands when something is about to happen—when something that is plaguing their society will be confronted and defeated by the human (who have thumbs and can fit in places a centaur can’t, so there are two big advantages for the human).<br /><br />But first, the centaur takes Regan to meet her family. And then years pass. She matures, she sees the errors she made in trusting the wrong people on Earth. She picks up skills, she learns who she is. Yes, she misses her family, but this is home to her and she’s content.<br /><br />THE HOOFLANDS <br />&lt;blockquote&gt;…and there were people. Centaurs like the ones Regan knew. More delicate centaurs with the lower bodies of graceful deer and the spreading antlers to match. Satyrs and fauns and minotaurs and bipeds with human torsos but equine legs and haunches, like centaurs that had been clipped nearly in half. It was a wider variety of hooved humanity that Regan could have imagined.&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br />On the one hand, I really like this world—of all the worlds on other sides of doors that we’ve visited in this series, it seems more viable than any of them (except maybe for maybe The Goblin Market), it takes a little less suspension of disbelief to see how the world works (once you accept the population, anyway).<br /><br />At the same time…there’s something about this society that I don’t understand how it functions at all given the way that other species see each other. Obviously, this is a not-at-all-thinly-veiled metaphor for our society, but even metaphors should have some sort of air of believability. Maybe it’s just me, but every time that came up, it took me out of the story for a bit, because I couldn’t understand how the world functions (set aside justice and morality, I’m talking just in terms of practicality). It’d take too long to flesh this out, so I won’t. But it bugged me.<br /><br />The individual people we spend time with in The Hooflands? Loved ‘em.  They’re the best characters we’ve met in this series that weren’t connected to the School. I resented how much time McGuire let pass between chapters because I wanted to spend more time with them and to understand the Centaur culture a bit more.<br /><br />SO, WHAT DID I THINK ABOUT <i>ACROSS THE GREEN GRASS FIELDS</i>? <br />&lt;blockquote&gt;It had been more than five years since Regan ran away from school on purpose and ran away from home by mistake.&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br />So begins the endgame for this particular novella, Regan heads off to meet the Queen and do what she was brought to the Hooflands to do once and for all, and then (she assumes) to get her door back home. She doesn’t really want to leave the Hooflands, but circumstances are forcing her hand.<br /><br />This is the crux of probably my biggest problem with the book—she’s spent five years telling anyone who’ll listen (primarily herself) that she doesn’t believe in Destiny, she won’t bend to Destiny. But in the end, that’s exactly what she does. I’m not going to get into a debate about determinism here, but Regan would be a great Exhibit A for my case if I wanted to.<br /><br />This is not a subtle book, McGuire has things she wants to say about destiny, about the choices that others make on behalf of others that are just as binding as the choices they make themselves. And she goes about it in a blatant, almost <b>ABC After School Special</b>* manner. And this series is better than that. Or it usually is.<br /><br /><i>* Readers of a certain age might want to consult with a parent to fully understand that reference</i><br /><br />I liked <b>Across the Green Grass Fields</b>, but this is not up to either McGuire’s standard or the standard of <b>The Wayward Children</b> series, and it was far enough short of those high marks that I’m having trouble generating much enthusiasm for it. The language, the storytelling style, the imaginative world were there. But they were overshadowed too frequently for my taste by the rest.<br /><br />I was disappointed. Hopefully, you’re not, or if you were, it doesn’t put you off from trying the rest of this really wonderful series.<br /><br />I fully expect (and hope) to see Regan at Eleanor West’s School for Wayward Children in the future and look forward to seeing what happens after she makes her way back home (even if I don’t think it’ll go well for her long-term). I’ll be back for the 2022 novella in this series, eager for what McGuire has in store, confident it won’t be like this.</p>', 'date': '2020-12-19', 'userId': 560}, {'reviewId': 2681519, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2020-12-30', 'userId': 10999}, {'reviewId': 2688995, 'score': 5, 'comment': None, 'date': '2021-02-07', 'userId': 10998}, {'reviewId': 2707582, 'score': 2, 'comment': '<p>I didn’t enjoy this one as much as I did the other books in this series.

1040373,Life in the Wilderness,2014,"At times, the wilderness is a place of darkness, a place of confusion, or a place in which no understanding of the circumstances can be found. Other seasons in the wilderness become the occasions when God imparts divine understanding, revelation, and richness to believers. In the wilderness is where the believer comes under God's sheltering wings and draws from His endless provisions. By learning to trust the Lord, even in the dry, empty, desolate places of life, a foundation is built. And it is in the wilderness that God's wondrous beauty and glory are discerned. This is a time in which true meaning and purpose for individual existence is found and explored. Life in the Wilderness teaches a believer at any level how to follow God, live a fulfilled life, and enter his or her Promised Land strengthened in the power of God. The author, Charles Haun, attempts to show God Himself as fully as human limitations allow. He also seeks to present as complete a picture of the ""wilderness"" as possible. Life in the Wilderness covers eleven wildernesses in the experiences of the children of Israel, bringing to life the spiritual purpose and meanings of the wilderness seasons in the life of a believer.",English,[],

1136791,Donna Noble: Kidnapped!,2020,,English,"[{'reviewId': 1668520, 'score': 4, 'comment': '<p>A four-episode story featuring Donna travelling in time and space and facing typical <i>Doctor Who</i> problems… but without the Doctor being present.<br /><br /><b>Out of This World</b> – The first episode sees Donna trying to get over the traumatic events of <i>Silence in the Library</i> by spending time at home away from the Doctor. Sylvia’s attempts to fix a problem she doesn’t really understand coincidentally draw Donna’s attention to an Earthbound mystery that seems to have alien involvement. And it’s from there that we kick off the arc that forms the basis of this collection. Despite ending on a minor cliffhanger, it feels comparatively standalone, as if it were the pilot episode for something bigger, setting up a concept without necessarily being part of anything bigger. (Rather like <i>Rose</i>, perhaps).<br /><br />The result is nonetheless a decent story, full of misunderstandings and seeing Donna placed in real peril towards the end. Sylvia is good in it, and there’s some great chemistry and banter between Donna and her old schoolfriend Natalie, who becomes the other major character in this mini-series – the “companion” to Donna’s “Doctor”. Donna’s late father also gets a mention, adding depth to Sylvia in particular, which is a nice touch. It’s not spectacular, but it’s a good start and shows that Donna has the strength to take centre stage without the Doctor being present. 4.5 stars. <br /><br /><b>Spinvasion</b> – Unfortunately, I didn’t feel that the same could be said for this second episode. It’s a comedy, and these are often hit-and-miss in <i>Doctor Who</i>. A lot probably depends on your sense of humour and I can’t say that this suited mine. The cliffhanger from the previous episode is dealt with perfunctorily and then we’re off to an alien planet where everyone is astoundingly stupid. Yes, it’s supposed to be a satire on PR, but it’s clumsily done, with cartoon characters and no real sense of peril – despite the fact that there’s clearly intended to be.<br /><br />One of the strengths of Donna (and Tate) on TV was her ability to be both mouthy and emotionally vulnerable, caring about the terrible things she was sometimes seeing, and drawing the audience in with her and making the fantastic seem real. There’s no sign of that here, just broad comedy based around people being thick, and Donna shrugging off the massive death toll that the story eventually includes (although largely off-screen). Natalie also seems to be taking to the strangeness far too easily and the whole thing just doesn’t feel at all believable. Which, at least for me, made the comedy fall flat. 2 stars.<br /><br /><b>The Sorcerer of Albion</b> – It’s something of a convention in Big Finish collections like this one that one of the four stories has to be set in the past. This time around, that’s medieval England as Donna is mistaken for Merlin (per the classic episode <i>Battlefield</i> this is apparently the Doctor, which is why nobody is surprised ‘Merlin’ has seemingly regenerated into a woman). It’s a considerable improvement over the previous episode, avoiding most of its pitfalls. For a start, it’s a good deal funnier, despite not obviously being a comedy – instead it has plenty of great one-liners, many of them at Donna’s expense.<br /><br />It also does a better job with Natalie. Indeed, she’s really the main character in this one, with Donna being side-lined for a chunk of it, forcing her reluctant companion to struggle on her own. This makes use of what was established about her in the first episode and shows a more plausible reaction to being unexpectedly thrown through time and space. There are some quite inventive ideas in here too, albeit largely in what would be the visuals were this a different medium. 4 stars.<br /><br /><b>The Chiswick Cuckoos</b> – The final episode returns to the present day to wrap up the loose threads from the first one. The focus is naturally back on Donna, although there are some good scenes with Natalie, showing her as the sort of character that would make a good companion but would never voluntarily chose such a life. Sylvia is back again, too, if not quite so prominently as in the first episode, and there are a couple of guest appearances from other recurring characters. <br /><br />Here, it’s up to Donna to save the Doctor, with the latter out of the picture and the result is a good piece of action-oriented fun. As in the previous episode, Donna is very much on form and there is some reflection on her relationship with her mother in between the action on alien spaceships and so on. Of all the episodes in this collection, this is also the most female-led, with the only male characters either unimportant or in the background for most of the story. (Which not only feels right, but goes to show that you can have an all-female “Doctor”/companion pairing without everyone assuming there’s a lesbian romance going on.) 4 stars.<br /></p>', 'date': '2023-01-26', 'userId': 7047}]",

Nihilistic annihilation, manifesting itself as the road of the naming of Nihil and of the production of thingly crystals (artificial world) as a result of that naming, usually is called “history”. Names of Nihil (language phenomena), being the antithesis of Nihil, falsify and cover up Nihil itself, turning it into “supreme” being, e.g. into “the One”, “God”, “Substance”, “Matter”, “Spirit”,ad infinitum.

'Pye writes like a dream. Magnificent' Jerry Brotton, author of A History of the World in Twelve Maps ______________ This is a story of saints and spies, of anglers and pirates, traders and marauders - and of how their wild and daring journeys across the North Sea built the world we know. When the Roman Empire retreated, northern Europe was a barbarian outpost at the very edge of everything. A thousand years later, it was the heart of global empires and the home of science, art, enlightenment and money. We owe this transformation to the tides and storms of the North Sea. Boats carried food and raw materials, but also new ideas and information. The seafarers raided, ruined and killed, but they also settled and coupled. With them they brought new tastes and technologies - books, science, clothes, paintings and machines. Drawing on an astonishing breadth of learning and packed with human stories and revelations, this is the epic drama of how we came to be who we are. ______________ 'A closely-researched and fascinating characterisation of the richness of life and the underestimated interconnections of the peoples all around the medieval and early modern North Sea' Chris Wickham, author of The Inheritance of Rome: A History of Europe from 400 to 1000 'Elegant writing and extraordinary scholarship . . . Miraculous' Hugh Aldersey-Williams, author of Periodic Tales and Anatomies 'Bristling, wide-ranged and big-themed . . . at its most meaningful, history involves a good deal of art and storytelling.

450696,Bear Necessity,2020,"A “refreshing,” (Kirkus Reviews) unpretentious, and uplifting story about a father and son reconnecting and finding happiness in the most unlikely circumstances—for fans of Nick Hornby and The Rosie Project. Danny’s life is falling apart. His eleven-year-old son, Will, hasn’t spoken since the death of his mother in a car crash a year earlier, and Danny has just been fired from his construction job. He’s behind on the rent and his nasty landlord is threatening to break his legs if he doesn’t pay soon. Danny needs money, and fast. After observing street performers in a local park, Danny spends his last few dollars on a tattered panda costume, impulsively deciding to become a dancing bear. While performing one day, Danny spots his son being taunted by a group of older boys. Danny chases them off, and Will opens up for the first time since his mom died, unaware that the man in the panda costume is his father. Afraid of disclosing his true identity, Danny comforts his son. But will Danny lose Will’s trust once he reveals who he is? And will he be able to dance his way out of despair? Filled with a delightful cast of characters, Bear Necessity is “a moving, sensitive story that is also very funny, and a perfect literary antidote to anxious, troubled times” (Shelf Awareness).",English,"[{'reviewId': 1718659, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2022-06-21', 'userId': 7206}, {'reviewId': 5757147, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2023-06-19', 'userId': 26026}]",

1538145,The Wolves of K Street: The Secret History of How Big Money Took Over Big Government,2024,"A dazzling and infuriating portrait of fifty years of corporate influence in Washington, The Wolves of K Street is a masterpiece of narrative nonfiction—irresistibly dramatic, spectacularly timely, explosive in its revelations, and absolutely impossible to put down. In the 1970s, Washington’s center of power began to shift away from elected officials in big marble buildings to a handful of savvy, handsomely paid operators who didn’t answer to any fixed constituency. The cigar-chomping son of an influential congressman, an illustrious political fixer with a weakness for modern art, a Watergate-era dirty trickster, the city’s favorite cocktail party host—these were the sort of men who now ran Washington. Over four decades, they’d chart new ways to turn their clients’ cash into political leverage, abandoning favor-trading in smoke-filled rooms for increasingly sophisticated tactics, such as “shadow lobbying,” where underground campaigns sparked seemingly organic public outcries to pressure lawmakers into taking actions that would ultimately benefit corporate interests rather than ordinary citizens. With billions of dollars at play, these lobbying dynasties enshrined in Washington a pro-business consensus that would guide the country’s political leaders—Democrats and Republicans alike. A good lobbyist could ghostwrite a bill or even secretly kill a piece of legislation supported by the president, both houses of Congress, and a majority of Americans. Yet nothing lasts forever. Amid a populist backlash to the soaring inequality these influence peddlers helped usher in, DC’s pro-business alliance suddenly began to fray. And while the lobbying establishment would continue to invent new ways to influence Washington, the men who’d built K Street would soon find themselves under legal scrutiny, on the verge of financial collapse, or worse. One would turn up dead behind the eighteenth green of an exclusive golf club, with a $1,500 bottle of wine at his feet and a bullet in his head.",English,[],2096

1266391,The Six Pack: On the Open Road in Search of Wrestlemania,2024,"From the bestselling author of The Wax Pack, comes another eye‑opening road trip adventure into a pocket of iconic pop culture—professional wrestling—starring the Iron Sheik, Hulk Hogan, Tito Santana, and many more larger‑than‑life characters of the WWF of the 1980s. In 2005, Brad Balukjian left his position as a magazine fact-checker to pursue a dream job: partner with his childhood hero, The Iron Sheik (whose real name was Khosrow Vaziri), to write his biography. Things quickly went south, culminating in the Sheik threatening Balukjian’s life. Now seventeen years later, Balukjian returns to the road in search of not only a reunion with the Sheik, but something much bigger: truth in a world built on illusion. Balukjian seeks out six of the Sheik’s contemporaries, fellow witnesses to the World Wrestling Federation’s (WWF) explosion in the mid-‘80s, to unearth their true identities. As Balukjian drives 12,525 miles around the country, we revisit the heady days when these avatars of strength, villainy, and heroism first found fame and see where their journeys took them. From working out with Tony Atlas (Tony White) to visiting Hulk Hogan’s (Terry Bollea) karaoke bar, we see where these men are now and how they have navigated the cliffs of fame. The Six Pack combines the spirit of a fan with the rigor of an investigative reporter, tracking down former WWF employees, childhood friends, and mutually curious archivists. Wrestling is perceived as a subculture without a cultural home, somewhere between sport and theater—often dismissed as silly and low‑brow. But what makes this book so compelling is the humanity beneath each wrestler. The Iron Sheik, Hulk Hogan, and the rest of the cast were not characters in a comic book movie. They were real people, with families and feelings and bodies that could break. Most of them did, in fact, break; some have been repaired, but none of them will ever be the same.",English,[],

453500,White Feminism,2021,"Written “with passion and insight about the knotted history of racism within women’s movements and feminist culture” (Rebecca Traister, New York Times bestselling author), this whip-smart, timely, and impassioned call for change is perfect for fans of Good and Mad and Hood Feminism. Addressing today’s conversation about race, empowerment, and inclusion in America, Koa Beck, writer and former editor-in-chief of Jezebel, boldly examines the history of feminism, from the true mission of the suffragists to the rise of corporate feminism with clear-eyed scrutiny and meticulous detail. She also examines overlooked communities—including Native American, Muslim, transgender, and more—and their ongoing struggles for social change. With “intellectually smart and emotionally intelligent” (Patrisse Cullors, New York Times bestselling author and Black Lives Matter cofounder) writing, Beck meticulously documents how elitism and racial prejudice have driven the narrative of feminist discourse. Blending pop culture, primary historical research, and first-hand storytelling, she shows us how we have shut women out of the movement, and what we can do to correct our course for a new generation. Combining a scholar’s understanding with hard data and razor-sharp cultural commentary, White Feminism “is a rousing blueprint for a more inclusive ‘new era of feminism’” (The Boston Globe).",English,"[{'reviewId': 447073, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2021-08-05', 'userId': 2020}, {'reviewId': 1531556, 'score': 3, 'comment': None, 'date': '2023-07-05', 'userId': 6468}, {'reviewId': 3550038, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2021-02-19', 'userId': 14189}, {'reviewId': 5522350, 'score': 5, 'comment': None, 'date': '2021-02-08', 'userId': 10135}]",

376618,The Temporal Void,2008,"Many of Peter F. Hamilton's dazzling novels, which offer startling perspectives on tomorrow's technological and cultural trends, are epic in scope, spanning vast stretches of space and time. And yet they are grounded in characters--human, alien, and other--who, for all their strangeness, are still able to touch our hearts and fire our imaginations. Now Hamilton returns to the universe of his acclaimed Commonwealth saga with The Temporal Void, the second volume in the trilogy that began with The Dreaming Void.Long ago, a human astrophysicist, Inigo, began dreaming scenes from the life of a remarkable human being named Edeard, who lived within the Void, a self-contained microuniverse at the heart of the galaxy. There, under the beneficent gaze of mysterious godlike entities, humans possessed uncanny psychic abilities, and Edeard's were the strongest of all. Equally strong was his determination to bring justice and freedom to a world terrorized by criminal violence and corruption. Inigo's inspirational dreams, shared by hundreds of millions throughout the galaxy-spanning gaiafield, gave birth to a religion--Living Dream. But when the appearance of a Second Dreamer seemed to trigger the expansion of the Void--an expansion that is devouring everything in its path--the Intersolar Commonwealth was thrown into turmoil. With the adherents of Living Dream determined to set forth on a dangerous pilgrimage into the Void, interstellar war threatens to erupt. With time running out, the fate of humanity hinges on a handful of people. There is Araminta, only now awakening to the unwelcome fact that she is the mysterious Second Dreamer--and to the dire responsibilities that go with it; Inigo, whose private dreams hint at a darker truth behind Edeard's legendary life; Paula Myo, the ruthless field operative of the Commonwealth, whose search for Araminta and Inigo is about to yield a most unpleasant surprise; and Justine, whose desperate gamble places her within the Void, where the godlike Skylords hold the power to save the universe . . . or destroy it.From the Hardcover edition.",English,[],

Written for emergent leaders in any endeavor, this new work from renowned consultant Richard Strozzi-Heckler offers a new approach to leadership. The first book of its kind to base business and management strength on integral body awareness, the book presents key principles such as shugyo, or self-cultivation, as crucial in developing the individual responsibility, social commitment, and moral and spiritual vision required to lead with authority and efficacy. The Leadership Dojo is based on three questions: What does a leader do? What are the character values most essential to exemplary leadership? How do you teach these values? Drawing on the wisdom of ages from Plato to the Bhagavad-Gita, from Thucydides to the Abidharma, the book asserts that understanding and answering these questions holds the key to superior leadership skills. Strozzi-Heckler teaches with real-world examples based on his wide experience training decision-makers at companies like AT&T and Microsoft. The book’s multifaceted approach helps readers establish a powerful Leadership Presence, a platform from which they can take ethical action with compassion and pragmatic wisdom.",English,[],2231

1693469,"Overlooked: A Celebration of Remarkable, Underappreciated People Who Broke the Rules and Changed the World",2023,"An unforgettable collection of diverse, remarkable lives inspired by “Overlooked,” the groundbreaking New York Times series that publishes the obituaries of extraordinary people whose deaths went unreported in the newspaper—filled with nearly 200 full-color photos and new, never-before-published content Since 1851, The New York Times has published thousands of obituaries—for heads of state, celebrities, scientists, and athletes. There’s even one for the person who invented the sock puppet. But, until recently, only a fraction of the Times’s obits chronicled the lives of women or people of color. The vast majority tell of the lives of men—mostly white men. Started in 2018 as a series in the Obituary section, “Overlooked” has sought to rectify this, revisiting the Times’s 170-year history to celebrate people who were left out. It seeks to correct past mistakes, establish a new precedent for equitable coverage of lives lost, and refocus society’s lens on who is considered worthy of remembrance. Now, in the first book connected to the trailblazing series, Overlooked shares 66 extraordinary stories of women, BIPOC and LGBTQIA figures, and people with disabilities who have broken rules and overcome obstacles. Some achieved a measure of fame in their lifetime but were surprisingly omitted from the paper, including Ida B. Wells, Sylvia Plath, Alan Turing, and Major Taylor. Others were lesser-known, but noteworthy nonetheless, such as Katherine McHale Slaughterback, a farmer who found fame as “Rattlesnake Kate”; Ángela Ruiz Robles, the inventor of an early e-reader; Terri Rogers, a transgender ventriloquist and magician; and Stella Young, a disabled comedian who rejected “inspiration porn.” These overlooked figures might have lived in different times, and had different experiences, but they were all ambitious and creative, and used their imaginations to invent, innovate, and change the world. Featuring stunning photographs, exclusive content about the process of writing obituaries, and contributions by writers such as Veronica Chambers, Jon Pareles, Amanda Hess, and more, this visually arresting book compels us to revisit who and what we value as a society—and reminds us that some of our most important stories are hidden among the lives of those who have been overlooked.",English,[],283

Now more than sixty of those pieces have been brought together in this sparkling new collection. ""People have often asked me how it feels to be the 'voice of the South,'"" writes Renkl in her introduction. ""But I'm not the voice of the South, and no one else is, either."" There are many Souths--red and blue, rural and urban, mountain and coast, Black and white and brown--and no one writer could possibly represent all of them. In Graceland, At Last, Renkl writes instead from her own experience about the complexities of her homeland, demonstrating along the way how much more there is to this tangled region than many people understand. In a patchwork quilt of personal and reported essays, Renkl also highlights some other voices of the South, people who are fighting for a better future for the region. A group of teenagers who organized a youth march for Black Lives Matter. An urban shepherd whose sheep remove invasive vegetation. Church parishioners sheltering the homeless. Throughout, readers will find the generosity of spirit and deep attention to the world, human and nonhuman, that keep readers returning to her columns each Monday morning. From a writer who ""makes one of all the world's beings"" (NPR), Graceland, At Last is a book full of gifts for Southerners and non-Southerners alike.",English,[],1624

No one was spared. Grandmothers were raped in front of their grandchildren; young girls witnessed their families being massacred before being taken as sex slaves. Nearly all the women who survived were victims of sexual violence or were profoundly affected by it. An astounding 70 percent are HIV-positive. In Rwanda's social and cultural climate, survivors who speak out face discrimination and isolation. The Men Who Killed Me features testimonials from 17 Rwandan survivors.

The main character is the very symbol of the shining knight in armor, and the way he’s portrayed still makes him a flawed human who strives for the perfection of what it means to be a knight.</p>', 'date': '2009-10-08', 'userId': 5847}, {'reviewId': 1669507, 'score': 5, 'comment': None, 'date': '2012-01-02', 'userId': 7053}, {'reviewId': 1556264, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2011-09-22', 'userId': 6624}, {'reviewId': 1950029, 'score': 5, 'comment': None, 'date': '2013-01-19', 'userId': 8474}, {'reviewId': 2528350, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2013-08-28', 'userId': 10468}, {'reviewId': 3409585, 'score': 5, 'comment': None, 'date': '2016-09-04', 'userId': 8729}, {'reviewId': 5750183, 'score': 5, 'comment': '<p>Woah, woah, woah!

1331270,Sensitive is the New Strong: The Power of Empaths in an Increasingly Harsh World,2021,"“I highly recommend this book for all empaths and their loved ones.” —Jack Canfield, co-author of the #1 New York Times bestselling Chicken Soup for the Soul series The New York Times bestselling author of Dying to Be Me returns with an inspirational guide for sensitive people looking to fully harness their gifts of intuition and empathy in today’s harsh world. International speaker, cancer survivor, and author of Dying to Be Me Anita Moorjani astounded fans across the globe with her New York Times bestselling book about overcoming cancer and her life-changing near-death experience. Now she returns with Sensitive Is the New Strong, a powerful, heartfelt book on harnessing and fostering empathic gifts in today’s difficult, fear-based world. Empaths not only sense other people’s emotions, but also absorb them—sometimes to their own disadvantage, often leading to overwhelming sensory overload and feelings of confusion or low self-esteem. Their willingness to help and please others might make them prey to opportunists or cause them to give away more energy than they can afford. But Anita Moorjani argues that it’s possible to turn this onslaught of emotional burden into a powerful tool. In a time when traits like sensitivity, kindness, and compassion are sorely undervalued, Moorjani helps empaths—whether emerging or acknowledged—navigate obstacles they may face and identify what makes them unique. Finally, she teaches them how to claim their true powers as empaths, to be their most authentic selves, shifting their own trajectory and leading to shift the trajectory of the planet in a more conscientious direction. Filled with eye-opening personal anecdotes, insights from other empaths, meditations, and self-affirming mantras, Sensitive Is the New Strong is an empowering book that demonstrates the positive power of sensitivity.",English,"[{'reviewId': 5348714, 'score': 5, 'comment': None, 'date': '2021-04-30', 'userId': 23920}]",30226

That’s a different story — especially when they’re Robin Hood outlaws of the Wild West being tailed by an uppity US Marshal half their age… From William W. Johnstone and J.A. Johnstone, legendary, bestselling masters of the classic Western with more than 50 million copies in print, the second in a rowdy new shoot-em-up series that proves old cowboys not only get wiser with age – they get bolder and crazier too… As proprietors of the growing D&T Cattle Company, Casey Tubbs and Eli Doolin finally have a business of their own. If they’re going to spend their remaining years corraling cows, at least they can line their own pockets with the fruits of their labor instead of making wealthy ranchers even wealthier. Unfortunately, the meat market has seen better days and the D&T’s finances are drying up faster than a rain puddle—leaving Casey and Eli no choice but to procure cash by any means necessary—usually robbing banks. Before long, Casey and Eli are the most wanted men in the West. Dogged by U.S. marshals and Texas Rangers, the old outlaws slip away time and again, gaining notoriety and being hailed as heroes by folks who have been victimized by corrupt bankers. Deputy U.S. Marshal Colton Gray, smart enough to suspect that the two cowboys are masquerading as old geezers, grudgingly respects Casey and Eli’s grit. But he won’t let that stop him from bringing them to justice. And if they don’t come peacefully, then Colton will teach them to respect law and order from the barrel of his gun. JOHNSTONE COUNTRY.

464838,The Art of Statistics,2019,"The definitive guide to statistical thinking Statistics are everywhere, as integral to science as they are to business, and in the popular media hundreds of times a day. In this age of big data, a basic grasp of statistical literacy is more important than ever if we want to separate the fact from the fiction, the ostentatious embellishments from the raw evidence -- and even more so if we hope to participate in the future, rather than being simple bystanders. In The Art of Statistics, world-renowned statistician David Spiegelhalter shows readers how to derive knowledge from raw data by focusing on the concepts and connections behind the math. Drawing on real world examples to introduce complex issues, he shows us how statistics can help us determine the luckiest passenger on the Titanic, whether a notorious serial killer could have been caught earlier, and if screening for ovarian cancer is beneficial. The Art of Statistics not only shows us how mathematicians have used statistical science to solve these problems -- it teaches us how we too can think like statisticians. We learn how to clarify our questions, assumptions, and expectations when approaching a problem, and -- perhaps even more importantly -- we learn how to responsibly interpret the answers we receive. Combining the incomparable insight of an expert with the playful enthusiasm of an aficionado, The Art of Statistics is the definitive guide to stats that every modern person needs.",English,"[{'reviewId': 781610, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2019-10-27', 'userId': 3278}, {'reviewId': 1718572, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2023-10-30', 'userId': 7206}, {'reviewId': 4652432, 'score': 3, 'comment': None, 'date': '2021-08-01', 'userId': 20479}, {'reviewId': 1173711, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2024-05-14', 'userId': 1259}, {'reviewId': 4876490, 'score': 4, 'comment': '<p>3.5</p>', 'date': '2020-07-10', 'userId': 21673}]",

The Moon's chief security office, Noelle DeRicci, does her best to hold the United Domes government together. But Retrieval Artist Miles Flint, dissatisfied with the investigation into the Anniversary Day events, begins an investigation of his own. He builds a coalition of shady operatives, off-the-books detectives, and his own daughter, Talia, in a race against time. A race, he quickly learns, that implicates organizations he trusts-and people he loves. Rusch offers up a well-told mystery with interesting characters and a complex, riveting storyline that includes a healthy dose of suspense, all building toward an ending that may not be what it appears. -RT Book Reviews The latest Retrieval Artist science fiction thriller is an engaging investigative whodunit starring popular Miles Flint on a comeback mission. The suspenseful storyline is fast-paced and filled with twists as the hero comes out of retirement to confront his worst nightmare. -GenreGoRoundReviews.com The book takes a fascinating turn into an alien underworld as Retrieval Artist extraordinaire Miles Flint returns along with his daughter Talia to uncover a plot that may dwarf the initial Anniversary Day attacks. This is juxtaposed against interplanetary politics and efforts by the Moon's Chief Security officer Noelle DeRicci to hold an uneasy United Domes government coalition together. We always like our intergalactic politics as truly alien, and Rusch delivers the goods.

1693476,"Consumptive Chic: A History of Beauty, Fashion, and Disease",2017,"""During the late 18th and early 19th centuries, there was a tubercular moment in which perceptions of the disease consumption (tuberculosis) became inextricably tied to contemporary concepts of beauty, playing out in the clothing fashions of the day. With the ravages of the illness widely regarded as conferring beauty on the sufferer, it became commonplace to regard tuberculosis as a positive affliction, one to be emulated in both beauty practices and dress. While medical writers of the time believed that the fashionable way of life of many women actually rendered them susceptible to the disease, Carolyn A. Day investigates the deliberate and widespread flouting of admonitions against these fashion practices in the pursuit of beauty. Through an exploration of contemporary social trends and medical advice revealed in medical writing, literature and personal papers, Consumptive Chic uncovers the intimate relationship between fashionable women's clothing and medical understandings of the illness. Illustrated with over 40 full color fashion plates, caricatures, medical images, and photographs of original garments, this is a compelling story of the complex connections between the body, beauty, and disease --and the rise of tubercular chic""--Back cover.",English,[],46102

579190,Sapiens. De animales a dioses / Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,2016,"El libro de no ficción del AÑO Un best seller internacional con más de un millón de ejemplares vendidos. Lúcido e iluminador: la historia de la humanidad en un solo volumen. Este es el fascinante relato de nuestra extraordinaria historia: de simios sin importancia a amos del mundo. ¿Cómo logró nuestra especie imponerse en la lucha por la existencia? ¿Por qué nuestros ancestros recolectores se unieron para crear ciudades y reinos? ¿Cómo llegamos a creer en dioses, en naciones o en los derechos humanos; a confiar en el dinero, en los libros o en las leyes? ¿Cómo acabamos sometidos a la burocracia, a los horarios y al consumismo? ¿Y cómo será el mundo en los milenios venideros? En Sapiens. De animales a dioses, Yuval Noah Harari traza una breve historia de la humanidad, desde los primeros humanos que caminaron sobre la Tierra hasta los radicales y a veces devastadores avances de las tres grandes revoluciones que nuestra especie ha protagonizado: la cognitiva, la agrícola y la científica. A partir de hallazgos de disciplinas tan diversas como la biología, la antropología, la paleontología o la economía, Harari explora cómo las grandes corrientes de la historia han modelado nuestra sociedad, los animales y las plantas que nos rodean e incluso nuestras personalidades. ¿Hemos ganado en felicidad a medida que ha avanzado la historia? ¿Seremos capaces de liberar alguna vez nuestra conducta de la herencia del pasado? ¿Podemos hacer algo para influir en los siglos futuros? Audaz, ambicioso y provocador, este libro cuestiona todo lo que creíamos saber sobre el ser humano: nuestros orígenes, nuestras ideas, nuestras acciones, nuestro poder... y nuestro futuro. • El fuego nos dio poder. • La conversación hizo posible que cooperáramos. • La agricultura alimentó nuestra ambición. • La mitología sostuvo la ley y el orden. • El dinero ofreció algo en lo que confiar. • Las contradicciones crearon la cultura. • La ciencia nos hizo imparables. Reseñas: «Aborda las cuestiones más importantes de la historia y del mundo modernos, y además está escrito con un estilo vívido e inolvidable.» Jared Diamond «Renueva la creencia en la capacidad de decidir de los propios lectores. El éxito más sorprendente y renovador de un libro de no ficción de la última década.» Shmuel Rosner, editor original (Israel) ENGLISH DESCRIPTION New York Times Bestseller From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity's creation and evolution—a #1 international bestseller—that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be ""human."" One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one—homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us? Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas. Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become? Featuring 27 photographs, 6 maps, and 25 illustrations/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work is sure to spark debate and is essential reading for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James Gleick, Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem.",English,"[{'reviewId': 1178354, 'score': 5, 'comment': None, 'date': '2021-12-26', 'userId': 5015}, {'reviewId': 999152, 'score': 5, 'comment': None, 'date': '2022-01-10', 'userId': 4165}, {'reviewId': 3616053, 'score': 4, 'comment': None, 'date': '2019-01-06', 'userId': 14516}]",

Apparently, there were only a few volumes during the 1920s that didn’t feature a story by Quinn about his character, Jules de Grandin. (Apparently, Quinn took Jules’ last name from his middle name.)<br /><br />There is no doubt that these stories are dated. They feature toe-curling racism, that is almost hilarious in its casual, unintended, offhanded offensiveness. Nonetheless, Quinn was a good writer. He was a lawyer who edited trade journals and wrote pamphlets on mortuary law.  Throughout these books, I was kept busy noting words that I had never or rarely seen.<br /><br />The stories feature Jules de Grandin and his Watsonish side-kick, Dr. Townsend. Jules is French, small, carries a deadly little pistol in a holster under his left armpit, knows virtually everything about everything, and has an unlimited appreciation for his own genius and skill.  I am not sure if he was patterned on Agatha Christie’s Hercule Poirer or vice versa, or both were patterned on a stereotype of a French man.<br /><br />Jules and Dr. Townsend live in Harrisonburg, New Jersey, which seems to be as much a hotbed for supernatural mysteries as Cabot Cove was for intricate murders. Invariably, the pair are brought into a mystery, chase after it, with Jules eventually solving it. Sometimes the mystery has a Scooby-Doo feel to it; other times, it involves something truly supernatural.<br /><br />The plots are probably the weakest part of the story. At times, it seems that they don’t exactly hold together, even as Jules explains everything at the end, but the plot problems are made up for with character and humor.  Quinn was turning out a lot of these stories, and while he might not be able to come up with reliable plots, his characterization of Jules as a pompous, self-assured rooster, with badly translated French and American expressions were reliably humorous.<br /><br />The introduction recommended not reading all these stories in one sitting. I think that is good advice.  Like reading Sherlock Holmes, letting the stories sit a bit, reading another book, perhaps, before returning, helps maintain the freshness of Quinn’s characters and writing style.</p>', 'date': '2018-08-17', 'userId': 16547}]",

More depth etc. There was a lot of potential in the story, and I think this would have made an excellent longer book. <br /><br />That said, it still gets a HUGE two thumbs up from yours truly.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>', 'date': '2017-04-05', 'userId': 19164}]",

But then the unthinkable happens, and Becky is charged with murder.

Nine months later, Becky is on trial and maintains her innocence—and so does Martha.

As the trial progresses, fault lines between the sisters begin to show—revealing cracks deep in their relationship and threatening the family each has worked so hard to build.

551991,The Roxy Letters,2021,"Meet Roxy. For fans of Where’d You Go, Bernadette and Bridget Jones’s Diary comes “just the kind of comic novel we need right now” (The Washington Post) about an Austin artist trying to figure out her life one letter to her ex-boyfriend at a time. Bridget Jones penned a diary; Roxy writes letters. Specifically: she writes letters to her hapless, rent-avoidant ex-boyfriend—and current roommate—Everett. This charming and funny twenty-something is under-employed (and under-romanced), and she’s decidedly fed up with the indignities she endures as a deli maid at Whole Foods (the original), and the dismaying speed at which her beloved Austin is becoming corporatized. When a new Lululemon pops up at the intersection of Sixth and Lamar where the old Waterloo Video used to be, Roxy can stay silent no longer. As her letters to Everett become less about overdue rent and more about the state of her life, Roxy realizes she’s ready to be the heroine of her own story. She decides to team up with her two best friends to save Austin—and rescue Roxy’s love life—in whatever way they can. But can this spunky, unforgettable millennial keep Austin weird, avoid arrest, and find romance—and even creative inspiration—in the process? With timely themes and hilarious, laugh-out-loud moments, Roxy Letters is a smart and clever story that is “bursting with originality, quirky wit, and delightful charm” (Hannah Orenstein, author of Playing with Matches).",English,"[{'reviewId': 818683, 'score': 3, 'comment': '<p>In a style similar to Bridget Jones’ Diary, this book is about Roxy, a young artist who is trying to make ends meet, find the right guy, and cope with her low-paying job at a Whole Foods deli counter.

Roxy has a LOT of misfortunes that are in turn laughable, cringeworthy, embarrassing, and more.  She has a good heart but has trouble finding her place in her world.

575858,Jewels,2007,"Throughout history, precious stones have inspired passions and poetry, quests and curses, sacred writings and unsacred actions. In this scintillating book, journalist Victoria Finlay embarks on her own globe-circling search for the real stories behind some of the gems we prize most. Blending adventure travel, geology, exciting new research, and her own irresistible charm, Finlay has fashioned a treasure hunt for some of the most valuable, glamorous, and mysterious substances on earth. With the same intense curiosity and narrative flair she displayed in her widely-praised book Color, Finlay journeys from the underground opal churches of outback Australia to the once pearl-rich rivers of Scotland; from the peridot mines on an Apache reservation in Arizona to the remote ruby mines in the mountains of northern Burma. She risks confronting scorpions to crawl through Cleopatra’s long-deserted emerald mines, tries her hand at gem cutting in the dusty Sri Lankan city where Marco Polo bartered for sapphires, and investigates a rumor that fifty years ago most of the world’s amber was mined by prisoners in a Soviet gulag. Jewels is a unique and often exhilarating voyage through history, across cultures, deep into the earth’s mantle, and up to the glittering heights of fame, power, and wealth. From the fabled curse of the Hope Diamond, to the disturbing truths about how pearls are cultured, to the peasants who were once executed for carrying amber to the centuries-old quest by magicians and scientists to make a perfect diamond, Jewels tells dazzling stories with a wonderment and brilliance truly worthy of its subjects.",English,[],

One messy, tangled case that can shatter a career. Turn a lawman into a renegade. And make him question words like honor, valor, and duty. For Jack Reacher, this is that case.New Year's Day, 1990. The Berlin Wall is coming down.  The world is changing.  And in a North Carolina ""hot-sheets"" motel, a two-star general is found dead. His briefcase is missing. Nobody knows what was in it. Within minutes Jack Reacher has his orders: Control the situation. But this situation can't be controlled. Within hours the general's wife is murdered hundreds of miles away. Then the dominoes really start to fall.Two Special Forces soldiers--the toughest of the tough--are taken down, one at a time. Top military commanders are moved from place to place in a bizarre game of chess. And somewhere inside the vast worldwide fortress that is the U.S. Army, Jack Reacher--an ordinarily untouchable investigator for the 110th Special Unit--is being set up as a fall guy with the worst enemies a man can have.But Reacher won't quit. He's fighting a new kind of war. And he's taking a young female lieutenant with him on a deadly hunt that leads them from the ragged edges of a rural army post to the winding streets of Paris to a confrontation with an enemy he didn't know he had. With his French-born mother dying--and divulging to her son one last, stunning secret--Reacher is forced to question everything he once believed...about his family, his career, his loyalties--and himself. Because this soldier's son is on his way into the darkness, where he finds a tangled drama of desperate desires and violent death--and a conspiracy more chilling, ingenious, and treacherous than anyone could have guessed.From the Hardcover edition.",English,"[{'reviewId': 5815007, 'score': 3, 'comment': None, 'date': '2014-12-15', 'userId': 26406}]",

Magnolia, South Carolina, 1980 Austin Foster is barely a teenager when her mama dies giving birth to twins, leaving her to pick up the pieces while holding her six siblings together and doing her best to stop her daddy from retreating into his personal darkness. Scratching out a living on the family’s tobacco farm is as tough as it gets. When a few random acts of kindness help to ease the Fosters’ hardships, Austin finds herself relying upon some of Magnolia’s most colorful citizens for friendship and more. But it’s next to impossible to hide the truth about the goings-on at Nolia Farms, and Austin’s desperate attempts to save face all but break her. Just when it seems she might have something more waiting for her—with the son of a wealthy local family who she’s crushed on for years—her father makes a choice that will crack wide-open the family’s secrets and lead to a public reckoning. There are consequences for loving a boy like Vance Cumberland, but there is also freedom in the truth. T. I.

Autopsy of a Crime Lab is the first book to catalog the sources of error and the faulty science behind a range of well-known forensic evidence, from fingerprints and firearms to forensic algorithms. In this devastating forensic takedown, noted legal expert Brandon L. Garrett poses the questions that should be asked in courtrooms every day: Where are the studies that validate the basic premises of widely accepted techniques such as fingerprinting? How can experts testify with 100-percent certainty about a fingerprint, when there is no such thing as a 100 percent match? Where is the quality control at the crime scenes and in the laboratories? Should we so readily adopt powerful new technologies like facial recognition software and rapid DNA machines? And why have judges been so reluctant to consider the weaknesses of so many long-accepted methods? Taking us into the lives of the wrongfully convicted or nearly convicted, into crime labs rocked by scandal, and onto the front lines of promising reform efforts driven by professionals and researchers alike, Autopsy of a Crime Lab illustrates the persistence and perniciousness of shaky science and its well-meaning practitioners.",English,"[{'reviewId': 4535696, 'score': 5, 'comment': None, 'date': '2024-07-24', 'userId': 19428}]",3224

A companion novel to Adrian Tchaikovsky's award-winning fantasy novel City of Last ChancesCity-by-city, kingdom-by-kingdom, the Palleseen have sworn to bring Perfection and Correctness to an imperfect world. As their legions scour the world of superstition with the bright flame of reason, so they deliver a mountain of ragged, holed and scorched flesh to the field hospital tents just behind the front line.Which is where Yasnic, one-time priest, healer and rebel, finds himself. Reprieved from the gallows and sent to war clutching a box of orphan Gods, he has been sequestered to a particularity unorthodox medical unit. Led by 'the Butcher', an ogre of a man who's a dab hand with a bone-saw and an alchemical tincture, the unit's motley crew of conscripts, healers and orderlies are no strangers to the horrors of war. Theirs is an unspeakable trade: elbow-deep in gore they have a first-hand view of the suffering caused by flesh-rending monsters, arcane magical weaponry and embittered enemy soldiers. Entrusted - for now - with saving lives deemed otherwise un-saveable, the field hospital's crew face a precarious existence. Their work with unapproved magic, necromancy, demonology and Yasnic's thoroughly illicit Gods could lead to the unit being disbanded, arrested or worse.Beset by enemies within and without, the last thing anyone needs is a miracle...

Just one chance dice game, that sets up and intensifies the existing tensions within the city. It was unique and it was bold and it was funny at parts and I loved it for just that. <br /><br />I love House of Open Wounds for completely different reasons. There are certainly gems of something I have always wanted for other books but nothing completely unique. Reading through House of Open Wounds reminded me of some of my favourite parts in the Malazan series with the irreverent (lol) bickering native to the corps. The ending as well tied together together the threads set up through out the book beautifully reminiscent of the Malazan books again. <br /><br />What sets this book apart from its predecessor is the characters. City of Last Chances while having a decent size of characters did not make me endear to any one of them. House of Open Wounds brings together a motley group of freaks who all bounce off of each other in interesting and fun ways. The world as well opens up to more than just Ilmar and it benefits heavily from that. The Palleseen are no longer straight up villainous but just people with their flaws and motivations.

Guild-like Clans now have control over all the dark and illegal trades, from the awful surgeries of the Frankenstein Clan, to the shadowy and seductive Vampire Clan, to the dreaded purveyors of drugs and death, the Clan of Mummies. And there’s always the Werewolf Clan, to keep order. Only one force stands opposed to the monster Clans: the superstrong, extremely sexy, quick-witted Hydes! Now Daniel is just one sip of Dr. Jekyll’s Elixir away from joining their company. At Jekyll & Hyde Inc. At the publisher's request, this title is sold without DRM (Digital Rights Management).

It is similar to book one’s cover keeping a nice symmetry throughout the series so far. It’s eye-catching. A fairly good representation of the story. It makes great use of graphics. The composition is really good, and the typography is interesting. <br /><br />I really rather enjoyed this one. Same engaging writing as book one. I felt the pacing in this one was much better. It held my interest from beginning to end. The mystery in this one didn’t have the same impact as the one in the previous book, but I was still surprised at who turned out to be the guilty party. <br /><br />Again we have a whole cast of interesting and likable secondary characters. There was a fascinating addition in this book (Declan Bishop), and I am extremely intrigued by him. As well as London’s two brothers. Although one seems to already be in a relationship. I was a tiny bit disappointed we didn’t get more Zach (the bad boy biker brother), but his book seems to be up next with Jinx as his heroine.<br /><br /> <br /><br />As for the main characters. Well, both were extremely likable. There was NO angst or drama relationship wise in this book. They just meet, got together and stayed together. I liked them as a couple, but I didn’t find them particularly exciting as a couple. In fact, I would say this book leaned way more towards the suspense side than it did the romance side. Which was fine since the mystery was intriguing enough that it carried the book.<br /><br />After reading both book one and two back to back, I can definitely say that this series has me hooked. The brothers. The friends and family connections. The continuing mystery. It all gives me a ROCK CHICK like vibe, and I LOVE that series, so me enjoying this one really in a no brainer. Two thumbs up from yours truly.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>', 'date': '2016-11-16', 'userId': 19164}]",

Wer würde mitmachen? Wie würden die Männer reagieren? Wie die Chefs und die Familienväter? <br /><br />Besonders gut gefallen haben mir die Einschübe aus Sicht von „Gebärmutter“ und „Pistole“.<br /><br />Den Weg zu dieser stillen Revolte kann man gut nachvollziehen. Die Wut der Frauen ist greifbar.<br /><br />Was ich etwas zu kurz gedacht finde, ist die zu krasse Trennung zwischen Mann und Frau. Es ist ein ziemliches schwarz-weiß denken und Verhalten, das sich in dem Buch wiederspiegelt.<br /><br />Alle Männer (außer dem einen männlichen Protagonisten) werden konsequent als Gefahr dargestellt, alle verhalten sich wie Raubtiere, die Frauen als minderwertig ansehen und sie objektifizieren. Natürlich haben sie komplett kein Verständnis für die Aktion der Frauen und wenn keine in den Clubs anzutreffen sind, machen sie sich auf den Weg um welche gewaltsam zur Befriedigung ihrer Bedürfnisse zu zwingen.<br />Natürlich sind alle Väter herrschsüchtige Patriarchen und alle Chefs ignorant gegenüber den Forderungen weiblicher Angestellter. <br />Natürlich reagiert die Regierung direkt mit Gesetzen die sich gegen die Frauen richten. <br /><br />Es mag gewollt sein, aber diese krasse Einteilung und das tun, als gäbe es weder männliche Feminist*innen noch Frauen, die das Patriarchat befürworten, macht die ganzen Überlegungen obsolet und absurd. Mag sein, dass „die Männer“ teilweise so reagierten, aber dass niemand ohne Hintergedanken „die Frauen“ unterstützen würden, ist einfach unglaubhaft und zerstört damit die grundsätzlich spannende Grundidee (zumindest für mich).<br /><br />Ein weiterer Punkt, der mich beim Lesen gestört hat, war die Stilisierung des männlichen Protagonisten als „Ausländer (TM)“. Es werden Klischees bedient und nicht näher drauf eingegangen, was der Ursprung der Familie ist, was vielleicht die ein oder andere Aktion und Reaktion erklärt hätte. <br />Hier kann es auch sein, dass ich allein stehe mit dieser Meinung und dass es durchaus gewollt ist, den Hintergrund so gering wie möglich zu halten. Mich hat es allerdings irritiert.<br /><br />Schade, denn sprachlich ist das Buch wieder wunderbar geschrieben und wie gesagt, die Frage, die dem ganzen zugrunde liegt ist durchaus spannend. <br /><br />Die Hörbuchversion ist zudem wirklich toll von allen Sprechern eingelesen worden.</p>', 'date': '2024-04-07', 'userId': 26026}]",

She was later tried and ultimately convicted for first degree murder of Morgan.
