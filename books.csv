1693399,Mortevivum: Photography and the Politics of the Visual,2024,"A powerful examination of the unsettling history of photography and its fraught relationship to global antiblackness. Since photography’s invention, black life has been presented as fraught, short, agonizingly filled with violence, and indifferent to intervention: living death—mortevivum—in a series of still frames that refuse a complex humanity. In Mortevivum, Kimberly Juanita Brown shows us how the visual logic of documentary photography and the cultural legacy of empire have come together to produce the understanding that blackness and suffering—and death—are inextricable. Brown traces this idea from the earliest images of the enslaved to the latest newspaper photographs of black bodies, from the United States and South Africa to Haiti and Rwanda, documenting the enduring, pernicious connection between photography and a global history of antiblackness. Photography's history, inextricably linked to colonialism and white supremacy, is a catalog of othering, surveillance, and the violence of objectification. In the genocide in Rwanda, for instance, photographs after the fact tell viewers that blackness comes with a corresponding violence that no human intervention can abate. In Haiti, the first black republic in the Western Hemisphere, photographic “evidence” of its sovereign failure suggests that the formerly enslaved cannot overthrow their masters and survive to tell the tale. And in South Africa and the United States, a loop of racial violence reminds black subjects of their lower-class status mandated via the state. Illustrating the global nature of antiblackness that pervades photographic archives of the present and the past, Mortevivum reveals how we live in a repetition of imagery signaling who lives and who dies on a gelatin silver print—on a page in a book, on the cover of newspaper, and in the memory of millions.

429051,One Last Stop,2021,"From the New York Times bestselling author of Red, White & Royal Blue comes a new romantic comedy that will stop readers in their tracks...

For cynical twenty-three-year-old August, moving to New York City is supposed to prove her right: that things like magic and cinematic love stories don’t exist, and the only smart way to go through life is alone. She can’t imagine how waiting tables at a 24-hour pancake diner and moving in with too many weird roommates could possibly change that. And there’s certainly no chance of her subway commute being anything more than a daily trudge through boredom and electrical failures.

But then, there’s this gorgeous girl on the train.

Jane. Dazzling, charming, mysterious, impossible Jane. Jane with her rough edges and swoopy hair and soft smile, showing up in a leather jacket to save August’s day when she needed it most. August’s subway crush becomes the best part of her day, but pretty soon, she discovers there’s one big problem: Jane doesn’t just look like an old school punk rocker. She’s literally displaced in time from the 1970s, and August is going to have to use everything she tried to leave in her own past to help her. Maybe it’s time to start believing in some things, after all.

Casey McQuiston’s One Last Stop is a magical, sexy, big-hearted romance where the impossible becomes possible as August does everything in her power to save the girl lost in time.",English,"[{'reviewiId': 785067, 'score': 4.0, 'comment': None, 'date': '2021-07-08', 'userId': 3311}, {'reviewiId': 264535, 'score': 5.0, 'comment': None, 'date': '2022-01-23', 'userId': 1191}, {'reviewiId': 205671, 'score': 5.0, 'comment': None, 'date': '2021-07-26', 'userId': 904}, {'reviewiId': 4639741, 'score': 4.0, 'comment': None, 'date': '2022-08-14', 'userId': 20371}, {'reviewiId': 31183, 'score': 3, 'comment': '', 'date': '2021-05-25', 'userId': 187}, {'reviewiId': 135495, 'score': 4.5, 'comment': None, 'date': '2022-05-08', 'userId': 642}, {'reviewiId': 85018, 'score': 4.0, 'comment': None, 'date': '2022-02-03', 'userId': 314}, {'reviewiId': 843250, 'score': 5.0, 'comment': None, 'date': '2021-06-07', 'userId': 3551}, {'reviewiId': 838629, 'score': 2.0, 'comment': '<p>Great concept, interesting characters, but this book is just too long for what it is.

Not only do you have time travel/ghost mystery, you also have a long lost missing uncle mystery, a beloved local diner about to go out of business, and the side characters, while lovable, sometimes overwhelming everything.<br /><br />If I were an editor on this, I would’ve recommended to cut some stuff out. Like, for example, in the beginning one of August’s roommates has a dog (a poodle named Noodles) and the dog is mentioned like one other time 2/3s of the way into the book and never again. So what’s the point?<br /><br />I would not say that anything was a bad idea, but I think it could’ve done without the long lost uncle. Just make the mom estranged from her family and that codependency being what August struggles with. You can have August really into true crime and doing detective stuff and if you sold it as something she was into on her own, it’s a much more believable passion.<br /><br />Just one or two more takes, is what I would suggest.<br /><br />That being said I really did love this book.

637378,The Melody,2018,"From the Booker Prize-shortlisted author of Harvest, Quarantine, and Being Dead, a tender new novel about music, lost love, and the way barely whispered fears and desires push their way into the light. Alfred Busi lives alone in his villa overlooking the waves, with only his trusted piano for company. Famed in his town for his music and songs, he is mourning the recent death of his wife and quietly living out his days--occasionally performing the classics in small venues, though never in the stadiums he could fill when in his prime. On the night before receiving his town's highest honour, Busi is wrested from his bed by noises in his courtyard, and then stunned by an attacking intruder. His hands and neck are scratched, and his face is bitten. Busi can't say what it was that he encountered, exactly, but he feels his assailant was neither man nor animal. The attack sets off a chain of events that will cast a shadow on Busi's career, imperil his home, and alter the fabric of his town. Busi's own account of what happened is embellished to fan the flames of old rumour--of an ancient race of people living in the surrounding forest--and to spark new controversy: something must finally be done about the town's poor, the feral vegabonds whose numbers have been growing. Meanwhile Busi, weathering a media storm, must come to terms with his wife's death and decide whether to sing one last time. The Melody is a story about grief and aging, about reputation and its loss, and the peculiar way myth seeps into real life. In trademark crystalline prose, Jim Crace portrays a man taking stock of his life and looking into an uncertain future, all while bearing witness to a community in the throes of great change--with echoes of today's most pressing social questions.",English,[],

This book is a fantastic guide to understanding the essential facets of astrology. The author begins by explaining that your birth chart is a snapshot of the positions of the planets at the moment you were born. With this understanding, she then guides you as you learn to interpret seemingly complex astrological information with ease. <br /><br />One thing that immediately caught my attention was the stunning cover on this book. It certainly carries on into the book with brilliant illustrations that add value to each section. I found it well laid out and easy to follow, making it perfect for newbies like me! The workbook is chock full of information about astrology and all the different signs, planets, etc., which makes it an excellent resource for those interested in learning more about themselves or others.<br /><br />Overall, Stefanie Caponi’s Guided Astrology Workbook is a must-read for anyone looking to expand their knowledge of astrology or discover more about themselves. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking insight and clarity in their lives.

1449337,Come Tomorrow You'll Regret Today: Collected Stories,2015,"In this fresh and subtle collection of short stories, Patrick Trotti offers a brutally vivid glimpse of millennial malaise in the Internet age. A high-school dropout struggles through the labyrinthine college admissions process as he is reluctantly drawn into the breakdown of his parents' toxic marriage. A recovering addict finds out on Facebook that his best friend is dead; a college freshman accidentally comes across his high-school girlfriend on a porn site. Set against a backdrop of abandoned factories, faceless strip malls, and suburban alienation, these unsettling and deceptively simple visions of post-industrial despair capture the ambivalence and innocence of a generation coming to terms with a fundamentally stagnant world.",English,[],157473

So returning to London after seven months' seclusion may have been a mistake.

1609766,I misteri della montagna,2015,"Non tutti hanno la capacità immediata di comprendere fino in fondo i segreti della montagna. Vedono le cime come blocchi turriti, pilastri di roccia scabri e senza valore, ammassi di pietre inutili sorti qua e là per capriccio del tempo. Basta, però, alzare lo sguardo ed essere sovrastati dall'imponenza del mare verticale, con i suoi milioni di granelli di sabbia, per sentire nascere lo stupore. Lo stupore che genera domande. Le domande che generano misteri: chi ci sarà lassù? Vi abita qualcuno? E, se esiste, come sarà fatto? Nei boschi, tra le rocce, dentro l'alba, sotto le foglie, sulle vette ancora inesplorate. Lì dormono i segreti della montagna. E Mauro Corona ci accompagna ancora una volta a scoprirli, tendendoci la mano, aiutandoci a salire. Ci esorta a giocare con il rimbalzo dell'eco, che vuole sempre l'ultima parola, ad ascoltare la voce del vento, che non sapremo mai da dove nasce. Ci conduce lungo i ruscelli a spiare le ninfe dai lunghi capelli d'acqua, ci indica il sentiero per raggiungere il grande abete bianco - adagiando l'orecchio al tronco, sentiremo il suo cuore battere. La montagna è viva, ha cinque sensi protesi a conoscere il mondo. E come tutti gli esseri speciali ha anche un senso in più: la percezione. Grazie a lei, può scoprire in anticipo le barbare intenzioni dei politici che vogliono ferirla, strizzarla, spremerla fino a distruggerla, pur di incassare moneta sonante. Ma la montagna resiste, perché ha un compito più grande: è stata creata affinché possiamo scrutare la nostra anima e diventare migliori. Scoprirla è scoprirsi. E se, in solitudine, saremo capaci di avvertire le presenze nascoste nel buio, avremo fatto il passo decisivo per capire che inseguire i misteri della montagna non vuol dire nient'altro che ricercare noi stessi, andando alle origini delle nostre paure. Il tempo delle curiosità non ha scadenza, dobbiamo solo farci trovare pronti per questa nuova, indimenticabile, avventura.",English,[],2367

They can mark inflection points in one's life, after which one is never quite the same. Most brief experiences capable of making a long-lasting impact involve obvious changes in one's outward circumstances, like a birth, a death, a marriage, or an illness. Yet some life-changing moments seem to come wholly from another source, appearing as mental states or altered states of consciousness either from deep within a person's mind or, perhaps, from a source beyond the self. These experiences have been called by different names over time: spiritual, religious, mystical, peak, or self-transcendent, and people around the world and throughout history have experienced them, up to and including the present day. The sacred texts of every major religion describe these moments, philosophers since the ancient Greeks have pondered them, and according to recent Gallup polls (2003), well over 30% of contemporary Americans have experienced them""--",English,[],107

667961,How to Win the Lottery with the Law of Attraction,2014,"HOW TO WIN THE LOTTERY WITH THE LAW OF ATTRACTION was written by Law of Attraction lottery winner, teacher and author Eddie Coronado. Based on interviews with actual winners who have used the Law of Attraction to win lottery prizes, this book provides the metaphysical tools and insights that are necessary to win lottery and contest prizes through the creative power of thoughts and feelings. Although this book contains the manifestation techniques of people who have won money, these metaphysical exercises can be used to attract the perfect mate, a new career, financial success, or anything that you can make a part of your beliefs and feelings. There is no limit to how much money and success you can manifest through the Law of Attraction because this immense spiritual power does not have an opinion about what you should or should not have. You can use the Law of Attraction to manifest ten cents or ten million dollars. The determining factor is belief and expectancy, which can be harnessed by using the spiritual tools discussed in this book.THIS BOOK CONTAINS FOUR PARTS:PART 1: This section explores the tools that are used for the manifestation techniques in this book. The tools covered are as follows: Affirmations, Creative Visualization, Expectation, Gratitude, and the Practice of Receiving. You should take the time to carefully read this section even if you are familiar with the Law of Attraction and the power of intention. This section contains a number of insights and explanations that may have been missed by other authors and teachers. For example, the Practice of Receiving is a powerful tool that can help you attract a lot of money, yet many Law of Attraction books do not mention this important exercise. In addition, I have included some helpful information about gratitude and affirmations as it relates to manifesting money. Affirmations of words, thoughts, feelings, and actions are also covered. Finally, the most important element of any manifestation technique is creative visualization, which every Law of Attraction lottery and contest winner has used to win prizes.PART 2: This section includes the manifestation techniques used by the winners who were interviewed for this book. Each winner, including the author, is introduced and his/her manifestation exercise is documented to reflect the exact steps taken to win lottery prizes. No changes have been made in order to preserve the integrity of each winner's method.PART 3: This is a Question and Answer Section that covers the most important questions about the manifestation techniques in this book. The answers have been provided by the lottery winners who were interviewed. This Question and Answer section will provide clarity and direction for those readers who are committed to using the Law of Attraction to manifest lottery prizes. The questions included in this section cover topics such as: Should I buy lots of tickets? How will I know that my intention will work? How long will it take for me to get results? What part does luck play in manifesting lottery prizes? In addition, a host of other important questions are discussed. PART 4: This section contains helpful tips and suggestions that will explain how to implement the following manifestation techniques and how to make the most of them. It also contains information regarding the common denominators of the winners' daily action plan in order to provide a clear understanding of the mental and emotional habits that are necessary for manifesting lottery prizes with the Law of Attraction.",English,[],

Their obsession with Taiwanese food and culture propelled them to open Win Son together in 2016. The East Williamsburg restaurant quickly established itself as a destination and often incurs long waits for their vibrant and flavorful Taiwanese-American cuisine. Ku and Brown have teamed up with Cathy Erway, Taiwanese food expert and celebrated writer, to create this book which explores and celebrates the cuisine of Taiwan and its ever-simmering pot of creative influences. Told through the eyes, taste buds, travels, and busy lives of Ku, Brown, and Erway, this book brings the cuisine of this misunderstood island nation into the spotlight. With 100 creative, yet accessible recipes, this book will unravel the history of this diaspora cuisine. While featuring classic dishes and well-known favorites, this cookbook also stretches this cuisine's definition, introducing new dishes with brazen twists that are fun, flavorful, and decidedly American-born in style.",English,[],3106

With the vilest of people, some more heinous than I ever knew they could be.
Stolen in plain sight and held captive in this dark, damp place where
I’m powerless to do anything but wait for my mates.

As time passes and they never come, I worry they’ve moved on.
Forgotten me. I mean, they already have her. Am I worth the trouble?
Time is almost out and X marks the day.
Secrets are revealed and pasts come back to haunt us.
Will Exodus win?
Will my mates go to war for me?
All I want is the end to come. Whatever that end may be.

1565044,What You Really Need to Lead: The Power of Thinking and Acting Like an Owner,2015,"As Harvard Business School professor and business executive Robert Steven Kaplan explains in this new book, leadership is accessible to all of us-today-and it starts with an ownership mind-set. You don't need an invitation to lead. Leadership is a dynamic way of thinking and acting that anyone can take on. For Kaplan, acting as a leader is a function of three key questions: 1. Do you work to figure out what you believe as if you were an owner? 2. Do you take action based on those beliefs? 3. Do you focus on adding value to others and take responsibility for the impact of your actions on others-both positive and negative? The book is full of stories taken from the author's own leadership experience as well as from his work helping various types of leaders and organizations. What's revealed is that leadership is not a role reserved for an elite few blessed with the right skills and key positions-it's about a focus on taking ownership and adding value to others. What's more, leadership is a lifelong journey of learning for which you must take responsibility. It's about learning to ask the right questions and learning to understand yourself. As in his earlier books, Kaplan asks probing questions, provides exercises, and suggests follow-up steps that will help you develop your skills, create new habits, and move you toward reaching your unique potential. What You Really Need to Lead is your key to unlocking the power of thinking and acting like an owner""--",English,[],7800

Grounded in current politics, in the work of artists Pauline Boty, Barbara Hepworth, Katherine Mansfield, and Loretta Mazzetti, and in Shakespeare's four final romances The Tempest, Cymbeline, Pericles, and A Winter's Tale, the Seasonal Quartet is ""one of modern fiction's most elusive and most important undertakings"" (Charles Finch, The Boston Globe).",English,[],

In the case of this book, I somehow found it charming…go figure. On top of that, the scene where they go to the biker compound made me laugh my ass off for ten minutes straight. I sincerely hope Hannah is getting her own book! It was also well written and well paced. As I said, the hero was a virgin. The heroine was NOT. There was no OW/OM drama. There were hot sex scenes. There was humor. Great secondary characters (the couple from book one and Hannah). Two very likable main characters. I ADORED Nate. Who doesn’t love a hot sexy cop? And Tillie was just as endearing.

Bernie Sanders takes on the 1% and speaks blunt truths about a system that is fuelled by uncontrolled greed, and rigged against ordinary people. Where a handful of oligarchs have never had it so good, with more money than they could spend in a thousand lifetimes, and the vast majority struggle to survive. Where a decent standard of living for all seems like an impossible dream. How can we accept an economic order that allows three billionaires to control more wealth than the bottom half of our society? How can we accept a political system that allows the super-rich to buy elections and politicians? How can we accept an energy system that rewards the fossil fuel corporations causing the climate crisis? How can we let it happen any longer? We must demand fundamental economic and political change. This is where the path forward begins. It's OK To Be Angry About Capitalism presents a vision of what would be possible if the political revolution took place.

477881,LA Naranja Mecanica,2003,"A Clockwork Orange is a dystopian satirical black comedy novel by English writer Anthony Burgess, published in 1962. It is set in a near-future society that has a youth subculture of extreme violence. The teenage protagonist, Alex, narrates his violent exploits and his experiences with state authorities intent on reforming him. The book is partially written in a Russian-influenced argot called ""Nadsat"", which takes its name from the Russian suffix that is equivalent to '-teen' in English. According to Burgess, it was a jeu d'esprit written in just three weeks.

In 2005, A Clockwork Orange was included on Time magazine's list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923, and it was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. The original manuscript of the book has been kept at McMaster University's William Ready Division of Archives and Research Collections in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada since the institution purchased the documents in 1971. It is considered one of the most influential dystopian books.

На главные из них — о лунных подделках, о техническом оснащении полетов, о состоянии астронавтов — ответы в этой книге. Автором движет не стремление убедить нас в том, что программа Apollo — свершившийся факт, а огромное желание поделиться тщательно проверенными новыми фактами, неизвестными изображениями и интересными деталями о полетах человека на Луну. Разнообразие и увлекательность информации в книге не оставит равнодушным ни одного читателя. Был ли туалет на космическом корабле? Как связаны влажные салфетки и космическая радиация? На сколько метров можно подпрыгнуть на Луне? Почему в наши дни люди не летают на Луну? Что входит в новую программу Artemis и почему она важна для президентских выборов в США?

In the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder, corporate America has doubled down on its public intentions to be more inclusive and equitable. Yet beyond the pledges it is difficult to see which system changes make a real difference. In From Intention to Impact, Malia Lazu draws on her background as a community organizer, her corporate career as a bank president, and now her experience as a leading DEI consultant to explain what has been holding organizations back and what they need to do better. First and foremost, she recognizes that truly moving from intention to impact means targeting and changing the traditions and culture that normalize whiteness. From Intention to Impact shows what organizations, leaders, and people at all levels must do to create more inclusive environments that honor and value diversity. Lazu shares a seven-stage guide through this process as well as a 3L model of listening, learning, and loving that readers can use from the initial excitement of doing “something” to the frustration when the inevitable pushback comes, and finally to the determination to do the hard work despite the challenges—on corporate and political fronts. Most compelling, From Intention to Impact shows that, while commitment from the top is paramount, for DEI to be most effective, it needs to be decentralized—among managers, within teams, and across the organization. A crucial read for anyone looking to future-proof their company, From Intention to Impact goes beyond the “feel good” PR-centric actions to showcase the real DEI work that must be done to create true and lasting systemic change.",English,[],151

The author was an astrophysics student at UC Berkeley who accidentally discovers a hacker while trying to explain a 75 cent(!!!) discrepancy in the computer time books. Rather than shut the guy out, Stoll spends months meticulously tracking the hacker’s moves through the early ‘net and creating a web of connections within basically every letter agency active at the time. Nobody wants to be the one agency to act, so there’s a lot of back-and-forth between agencies at various points of the book, until someone finally loses patience, blinks, and the hacker gets caught.<br /><br />I had a few issues with the book. I understand it’s basically a computer period piece of how technology was at the time, but it still got super repetitive about halfway through. The beginning was really interesting, the end was similarly compelling, but the middle was basically a series of “I see the hacker in my systems, here’s what he’s doing, I wish I could stop him” short segments. I also was mildly annoyed at the author’s massive Main Character Syndrome, where he turns the hacker information over to the proper authorities, and then gets all shocked/angry/annoyed at not being immediately privvy to whatever the government does with the information. Long segments of the book are dedicated to the author waxing philosophical about how he’s working with The Man and how much he hates not knowing what’s going on. It gets kind of annoying.<br /><br />I did like the glimpse into the computer technology from the period, though. I liked reading about the innovative ways the author used to track the hacker, determine his location, and mess with him to keep him on the line long enough to be traced. Well done in that respect.<br /><br />Just kind of a mixed bag of a book all around, honestly.</p>', 'date': '2021-07-18', 'userId': 3055}, {'reviewiId': 2617016, 'score': 4.0, 'comment': None, 'date': '2023-12-27', 'userId': 10705}, {'reviewiId': 1659993, 'score': 4.0, 'comment': '<p><b>Executive Summary:</b> A truly excellent and fascinating tale of hacking in the early days of the internet.<br /><br /><b>Full Review</b><br />I’m fascinated with computer crime. I have for as long as I can remember being interested in computers. Somehow I had never managed to read this book. <br /><br />I’m glad I finally got around to it. It might be my new favorite. Cliff Stoll tells an engaging and personal story of his discovery of computer networks, security exploits and computer crime that reads more like a spy novel than a technical manual.<br /><br />I think Mr. Stoll does a good job of making things easy to understand for the non-technical person. It has just enough detail to follow the story without being overwhelming. Of course being a computer person myself, I may not be the best to judge how technical this book gets.<br /><br />This book overlaps with some other stories of computer crime I’ve read and re-sparked my interest in reading some others I have on my backlog, along with rereading one I read back in high school that seems to overlap with this one a bit.<br /><br />It’s hard for me to judge how non-techies will enjoy this book, but anyone who wants to see what things were like in the early days of the internet should find this fascinating.<br /><br />The most remarkable thing was how little the various law enforcement agencies seemed to care. It was really the wild-wild west of computer crime. To the FBI, unless they physically stole something, destroyed something or cost your millions of dollars, it wasn’t worth pursuing.<br /><br />How do you quantify computer time? Especially back then when computers weren’t affordable and resources were limited. What about the time Cliff Stoll spend tracking the hacker? Time he should have spent doing his job.

A good representation of the hero. Good composition as well. The font used for the title is a bit too thin (IMO) which makes it a bit hard to read. <br /><br />I enjoyed this one for the most part. It was a bit slow and repetitive at times, but overall it wasn’t a bad read. The writing was good. The pace as I said was a bit too slow for me. The plot was engaging. It wasn’t very angsty and had no OW/OM drama. Although the hero does go to the BDSM club and makes plans with a sub there, he realizes it doesn’t feel right and ends the scene. There are also flashback sex scenes of when she was being held captive. There was only a single sex scene between the hero/heroine that takes place at 75% into the book. But it was a very emotional and poignant scene that brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br /> <br /><br />There was a nice collection of secondary characters (couples from previous books). And both main characters were likable. Donovan had the patience of a saint, and I really liked him. Although I would have preferred the book had moved a bit quicker so we would have gotten more time spent with Donovan in DOM mode. Phebe was also quite a good heroine. My heart broke for her, but she was strong and determined to take her life back. I loved whenever she called Donovan out on him treating her like she was going to break. Lastly, it was all wrapped up in a short and sweet epilogue. This one gets a solid thumbs up from yours truly.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>', 'date': '2017-10-01', 'userId': 19164}]",881

1291807,The Blue Mimes: Poems,2024,"Sara Daniele Rivera’s award-winning debut is a collection of sprawling elegy in the face of catastrophic grief, both personal and public. From the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election through the COVID-19 pandemic, these poems memorialize lost loved ones and meditate on the not-yet gone—all while the wider-world loses its sense of connection, safety, and assurance. In those years of mourning, The Blue Mimes is a book of grounding and heartening resolve, even and especially in the states of uncertainty that define the human condition. Rivera’s poems travel between Albuquerque, Lima, and Havana, deserts and coastlines and cities, Spanish and English—between modes of language and culture that shape the contours of memory and expose the fault lines of the self. In those inevitable fractures, with honest, off-kilter precision, Rivera vividly renders the ways in which the bereft become approximations of themselves as a means of survival, mimicking the stilted actions of the people they once were.

Each one has a compelling world. Her new “Valkyrie” series is no different. Imagine a world where the supernatural, global god pantheons (in this book, it heavily relies on the Norse pantheon), and technology come alive, peacefully coexisting with their own rules and regulations. This is the world Hocking drops us into. I’m such a geek for magic and technology; Shadowrun the RPG being one of my all-time favorite game settings. So, I was pleasantly squeeing when I dove into this book.<br /><br />In Between the Blade and the Heart, we’re introduced to Malin, a Valkyrie-in-training. She’s just come back from her latest assignment to find an intruder in her apartment. And thus, starts the quest that leads us through the rest of the story, that takes her through her city, pushing her past what she thought was the truth about her vocation, and deep into Mexico.<br /><br />Hocking does a great job of building her books. The world feels real, her characters are wonderfully flawed, and they feel real wandering around their setting. This new series is fast paced, contains a great bi-love triangle (about time!), and leaves us with a cliff-hanger that I didn’t see coming (too much). It also contains the cutest little pet critter I’ve ever read in a book (Malin, if you read this… I’d be more than happy to take care of Bowie any time). <br /><br />If you like your urban fantasy with a mythical twist, some cool technology, and a bunch of kick-ass heroines, then give Between the Blade and the Heart a read.

Brendan O'Carroll takes readers back to the heart of working-class Dublin, this time in the 1940s. Together with her soon to be lifelong best friend Marion Delany, young Agnes manages to survive the indignities and demands of Catholic school, the unwanted births of siblings, days spent in the factories and markets, and nights in the dance hall as rock-and-roll invades Dublin. But on the eve of her wedding night, the Jarro is alive with gossip—will Agnes be turned away at the altar? For the whole parish knows Agnes's not-so-well-kept secret. And with a mother falling further into dementia, and a younger sister turning to a life of crime, it's up to Agnes alone to keep her splintering family together, while trying to create one of her own. Filled with O'Carroll's trademark wicked wit and loving, larger-than-life characters, The Young Wan shows the hardscrabble beginnings of the ultimate Irish mother and family.",English,[],1

I read it as a city that was causing trouble for a country, but knew that couldn’t be right (contextually speaking.)   I am glad that I stuck with it though, because it wasn’t much past 6% into the novel when the story started to resonate for me.

In one week, Maude will be dead. At least, that's what she wants everyone to think. After years of research, Maude has decided to fake her own death. She's figured out the how, the when, the where, and who will help her unsuspectingly. The why is complex: revenge, partly. Her terrible parents deserve this. But there's also 'l'appel du vide,' the call of the void, that beckons her toward a new life where she will be tied to no one, free and adrift. Then Frankie, a stepcousin she barely knows, figures out what she's plotting, and the plan seems like it's ruined. Except Frankie doesn't want to rat her out. Frankie wants in. The girls vault into the unknown, risking everything for a new and limitless life. But there are some things you can never run away from. What if the poison is not in the soil, but in the roots? This pulse-pounding thriller offers a nuanced exploration of identity, freedom, and falling in love while your world falls apart.",English,"[{'reviewiId': 954150, 'score': 3.0, 'comment': None, 'date': '2022-05-12', 'userId': 4019}, {'reviewiId': 406686, 'score': 3.0, 'comment': None, 'date': '2022-09-07', 'userId': 1824}, {'reviewiId': 2791383, 'score': 3.0, 'comment': None, 'date': '2023-01-25', 'userId': 11324}, {'reviewiId': 4050924, 'score': 2.0, 'comment': None, 'date': '2023-09-29', 'userId': 16868}, {'reviewiId': 4069410, 'score': 4.0, 'comment': '<p>We need an extra chapter of Maude figuring out her ankle bracelet and draining the bank account and all that..

The Greek word for tragedy means “goat song.” Is Oedipus the goat? Helene Peet Foley calls him “the kind of leader a democracy would both love and desire to ostracize.” The Oedipus Casebook readings weigh the evidence against Oedipus, place the play in the context of Greek scapegoat rites, and explore the origins of tragedy in the festival of Dionysus. This unique critical edition includes a new translation of the play by distinguished classics scholar Wm. Blake Tyrrell and the authoritative Greek text established by H. Lloyd-Jones and N. G.

Titled after Soft Cell's version of the original 1965 Gloria Jones track, Tainted Love is the first book-length inquiry into the subject of the twisted romantic ballad, giving a sense of both its history and contemporary currency. Sometimes extreme, this twist to the conventional romantic ballad spans across gender and generational boundaries to subvert our understanding of both the genre’s function and its behavior. Each chapter of Tainted Love takes a deep dive into a single twisted ballad, examining both its inner workings—lyrics, melody, and vocal approach—and its broader cultural resonance. Featuring an analysis of songs by Kendrick Lamar, Nina Simone, Roxy Music, Joni Mitchell, The Velvet Underground, Frank Sinatra, Soft Cell, Paul McCartney, Charlotte & Serge Gainsbourg, PJ Harvey & Nick Cave, and Little Simz, this book turns on the question: What compels songwriters to compose—and us to listen to—these warped songs?",English,[],151

All the chapters bring together both the orthodox medical viewpoint with that of the complementary therapist.Included within the book are chapters on Spiritual Healing, Massage and Aromatherapy, Shamanistic and Magical Practices, Counselling (with Tarot and Past Life Regression) plus a chapter on Last Rites.

Guiding us through the strange and fascinating workings of the subatomic realm to create a new model of human consciousness, the author addresses enduring philosophical questions. Does the new physics provide a basis by which our consciousness might continue beyond death? How does the material world (for instance, ugly inner cities) impinge upon our sense of self? Is there a subatomic wellspring from which our creativity, our empathy with others, and our feelings of unity with the inanimate world originate? Most important, Zohar shows how the vitality of the new physics combats the alienation and fragmentation of twentieth-century life, and replaces it with a model of reality in which the universe itself may possess a type of consciousness, of which human consciousness is one expression.",English,[],618

1386016,The Toad and the Jaguar,2013,"ABOUT THE BOOK In this monograph the author relates findings from more than 30 years of experiences and observations with Bufo alvarius and 5-methoxy-dimethyltryptamine, in various user groups and individuals, both in the US and in Europe. The term underground is used in referring to the explorations with these substances, in the sense that they were hidden - out of respect for the restrictions and prohibitions of mainstream culture. These are ethnographic field reports, first-hand observations from an underground sub-culture, accompanied by the experiences of a selected number of participant-observers. It is important to recognize that in research with these and other so-called psychedelic or entheogenic substances, one cannot limit the observations and reflections solely to their physical and psychological effects. As most of the people cited here emphasize, the experiences with these substances at times can go far beyond their physical and psychological effects into the deepest and highest dimensions of our existence, both the cosmic and the spiritual. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Ralph Metzner, Ph.D., received his undergraduate degree at Oxford University and his doctorate in clinical psychology at Harvard University, where he was also the recipient of an NIMH Post-doctoral Fellowship in psychopharmacology at the Harvard Medical School. He collaborated with Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert in the studies of psychedelic drugs and co-authored The Psychedelic Experience. He is a psychotherapist and Professor Emeritus at the California Institute of Integral Studies, where he taught for 30 years. He has a life-long interest in the many different realms of consciousness and its modifications. He is the author of The Well of Remembrance, The Unfolding Self, Green Psychology, Birth of a Psychedelic Culture (with Ram Dass); editor of two collections of essays on ayahuasca and on psilocybe mushrooms; and author of a new series of seven books on The Ecology of Consciousness.",English,[],

Because verbal formulations are insufficiently specific and mathematical formulations often too restrictive, the author proposes a new formal language as a middle way, advocating computer simulation models to allow the formulation of more dynamic theories.",English,"[{'reviewiId': 4535810, 'score': 3.0, 'comment': None, 'date': '2018-04-21', 'userId': 19428}]",10183

As they uncover their letters, journals, and poems, and track their movements from London to Yorkshire—from spiritualist séances to the fairy-haunted far west of Brittany—what emerges is an extraordinary counterpoint of passions and ideas.

146637,Typographic Systems,,"Typographic organization has always been a complex system in that there are so many elements at play, such as hierarchy, order of reading, legibility, and contrast. In Typographic Systems, Kim Elam, author of our bestselling books, Geometry of Design and Grid Systems, explores eight major structural frameworks beyond the grid including random, radial, modular, and bilateral systems. By taking the reader through exercises, student work, and professional examples, Elam offers a broad range of design solutions. 
Once essential visual organization systems are understood the designer can fluidly organize words or images within a structure, combination of structures, or a variation of a structure. With clarity and substance, each system from the structured axis to the nonhierarchical radial array is explained and explored so that the reader comes away with a better understanding of these intricate complex arrangements. Typographic Systems is the seventh title in our bestselling Design Briefs series, which has sold more than 100,000 copies worldwide.",English,"[{'reviewiId': 1704775, 'score': 5.0, 'comment': None, 'date': '2023-03-05', 'userId': 7180}]",

Bolton demonstrates that the inevitable consequences of these doctrines being predicated on the fallacy of universal equality is the need for increasingly draconian laws, pervasive indoctrination, and, where these are insufficient, ""color revolution"" and war. Like the Jacobin doctrine of ""liberty, equality, fraternity,"" these measures, undertaken in the name of ""human rights,"" ""equality,"" and ""social justice,"" are largely directed toward the destruction of European peoples. The ultimate aim behind the humanitarian facade is a world state where people, resources, technology, and capital can be moved about without any hindrance from nation states, races, cultures, and even families. Extensively sourced, with forewords by Dr. Tomislav Sunic and Prof. Edward Dutton, Antelope Hill Publishing is proud to present The Tyranny of Human Rights: From Jacobinism to the United Nations by renowned author Kerry R. Bolton. This latest contribution by Bolton is a vital tool in understanding the nefarious machine of international human rights.",English,[],191072

OK composition and interesting title work. <br /><br />To start with I am going to admit that I am in a bit of a mood funk today. And I am guessing that played a big part in how nitpicky I was being while reading this one. Pushing that aside I will say that I did enjoy it overall.<br /><br />The writing was good. The pace was excellent and I never felt the need to skim. There was some OW drama that was pointless (IMO) since it didn’t cause any issues. I am SO over ridiculous cartoon villain like behavior from OW in these books. Especially in a case like this where it didn’t cause a problem at all and was wrapped up with very little fanfare. There was a nice array of secondary characters as well. Although the mother felt a bit like an afterthought and I would have liked to have seen more involvement in the story from her character. <br /><br /> <br /><br />Olivia was a sweet heroine. I don’t have a lot to say about her. I liked her personality. I do wish she would have shown more backbone at times instead of settling when it came to how she thought Nico felt about her. Nico, on the other hand, I had a love/hate relationship with. For the first 40% of the book his constant inner thoughts about using her and sending her back, not to mention his hot/cold routine grated on my nerves. The first couple times he had sex with the heroine felt cold to me. Especially the one in the dressing room. I did warm up to him as the book went on, but I still ended up being annoyed at his inability to admit he loved her right up until the book was almost finished. The whole Valentine Day thing pissed me off immensely, and I wanted Olivia to take a stand and decide she deserved more than a guy who couldn’t love her. <br /><br />But like I said, even with the things that annoyed me I still got sucked into the story and ended up enjoying it.

808369,Hitler,1974,"“The best single volume available on the torturous life and savage reign of Adolf Hitler.” —Time A bestseller in its original German edition and subsequently translated into more than a dozen languages, Joachim Fest’s Hitler has become a classic portrait of a man, a nation, and an era. Fest tells and interprets the extraordinary story of a man’s and nation’s rise from impotence to absolute power, as Germany and Hitler, from shared premises, entered into their covenant. He shows Hitler exploiting the resentments of the shaken, post–World War I social order and seeing through all that was hollow behind the appearance of power, at home and abroad. Fest reveals the singularly penetrating politician, hypnotizing Germans and outsiders alike with the scope of his projects and the theatricality of their presentation. Perhaps most importantly, he also brilliantly uncovers the destructive personality that aimed for and achieved devastation on an unprecedented scale. As history and biography, this is a towering achievement, a compelling story told in a way only a German could tell it: “dispassionately, but from the inside” (Time).",English,[],

1693419,The Secret of Culture Change: How to Build Authentic Stories That Transform Your Organization,2023,"Find out how bold actions by visionary leaders can inspire powerful stories that drive culture change. Data indicates that most strategic efforts to change a company's culture fail. So how do companies succeed in this endeavor? A top strategy professor and two highly successful CEOs found that, in companies that had successfully changed their culture, leaders had taken dramatic actions that embodied the new cultural values. These actions inspired stories that became company legends, repeated in every department and handed on to new employees. Through compiling and analyzing 150 stories from business leaders who have achieved change, they identified 6 attributes that every successful culture change story has in common: 1. The actions that build these stories are authentic 2. These stories ""star"" the leader 3. They signal a clean break with the past, and a clear path to the future 4. They appeal to employee heads and hearts 5. They're often theatrical or dramatic 6. They're told, and re-told, throughout the organization With extensive and inspiring examples of stories containing these attributes, the authors illustrate how readers can harness the power of stories within their company in order to change or create a winning culture to align with any strategy.",English,[],1344

One hundred and fifty years from now, in a world where Africa is the dominant technological and economic power, and where crime, war, disease and poverty have been banished to history, Geoffrey Akinya wants only one thing: to be left in peace, so that he can continue his studies into the elephants of the Amboseli basin.

After the death of Eunice, Geoffrey's grandmother, erstwhile space explorer and entrepreneur, something awkward has come to light on the Moon, and Geoffrey is tasked - well, blackmailed, really - to go up there and make sure the family's name stays suitably unblemished. But little does Geoffrey realise - or anyone else in the family, for that matter - what he's about to unravel. Eunice's ashes have already have been scattered in sight of Kilimanjaro.

This book is built on Illuminati Secret Knowledge and secret CIA reports of world events of 2035 and 2041 that no one except two Presidents and a few generals ever saw. Also the book is based on the serious scientific theories such as retro-causality when future is affecting the past as well as the accounts of people who claim that they saw the future: from Nostradamus and Baba Vanga to the accounts of so called modern time travelers. We researched dozens of them and found a couple of them to be credible because they are keep repeating the same things: some from the distant past while others are from the far future, so don't be surprised if you live though World War Three, the Great American Earthquake and Earth's orbit change till 2041 to see how accurately this book predicted other future events that seems insane today.",English,[],

A phenomenal debut novel by one of my favorite writers.” —CLINT SMITH, #1 New York Times bestselling author of How the Word Is Passed Seth is a junior copywriter whose latest tagline just went viral. He’s the agency’s hottest new star, or at least he wants his coworker crush to think so. But while he’s busy drooling over his future corner office, the walls crumble around him. When his job lets him go, he can’t let go of his job. Unfortunately, one former colleague can’t let him go either: Robert “Moon” McCloone, a skeezy on-the-rise exec better suited to a frat house than a boardroom. Seth tries to forget Moon and rediscover his spiritual self; he studies Kabbalah with an Orthodox rabbi by day while popping illegal prescription pills by night. But with each misstep, Seth strays farther from salvation—though he might get there, if he could only get out of his own way. In his debut novel, Purkert incisively peels back the layers of the male ego, revealing what’s rotten and what might be redeemed. Brimming with wit, irreverence, and soul-searching, The Men Can’t Be Saved is a startlingly original examination of work, sex, addiction, religion, branding, and ourselves.",English,"[{'reviewiId': 5705859, 'score': 3.0, 'comment': None, 'date': '2023-02-15', 'userId': 25728}]",

525032,Work for It,2019,"Between men like us, trust doesn't come easy. In this village, I’m an outcast: Griffin Everett, the scowling giant who prefers plants to people. Then I meet Keynes, a stranger from the city who’s everything I’m not: sharp-tongued, sophisticated, beautiful. Free. For a few precious moments in a dark alleyway, he’s also mine, hot and sweet under the stars… until he crushes me like dirt beneath his designer boot. When the prettiest man I’ve ever hated shows up at my job the next day, I’m not sure if I want to strangle him or drag him into bed. Actually—I think I want both. But Keynes isn’t here for the likes of me: he makes that painfully clear. With everyone else at work, he’s all gorgeous, glittering charm—but when I get too close, he turns vicious. And yet, I can’t stay away. Because there’s something about this ice king that sets me on fire, a secret vulnerability that makes my chest ache. I’ll do whatever it takes to sneak past his walls and see the real man again. The last thing I expect is for that man to ruin me. Work for It is 80,000 words of hot, angst-filled, M/M romance featuring a cynical city boy, a gruff, soft-hearted farmer, and a guaranteed happy-ever-after. No cheating, no cliff-hangers, just love. (Eventually.) This story is a spin-off set in the Just for Him world, taking place after the last book in that series.

376656,The Children of Jocasta,2017,"Thebes is a city in mourning, still reeling from a devastating attack of plague that invaded every home and left the survivors devastated and fearful. This is the Thebes that Jocasta has known her entire life, a city ruled by a king--her husband-to-be. Jocasta struggles through this miserable marriage until she is unexpectedly widowed--now free to choose her next husband, she selects the handsome, youthful Oedipus. When whispers emerge of an unbearable scandal, the very society that once lent Jocasta its support seems determined to destroy her. Ismene is a girl in mourning, longing for the golden days of her youth--days spent lolling in the courtyard garden, reading and reveling in her parents' happiness and love. Now she is an orphan, and the target of a murder plot, attacked within the very walls of the palace. As the deadly political competition swirls around her, she must uncover the root of the plot - and reveal the truth of the curse that has consumed her family. The novel is based on Oedipus Tyrannus and Antigone , two of Classical Greece's most compelling tragedies. Told in intersecting narratives, this feminist reimagining of Sophocles' classic plays brings life and voice to the women who were too often forced to the background of their own stories. It is compulsively entertaining fiction that recasts these familiar stories for the twenty-first century reader.",English,"[{'reviewiId': 1312495, 'score': 4.0, 'comment': None, 'date': '2021-06-07', 'userId': 5622}, {'reviewiId': 1687081, 'score': 3.0, 'comment': None, 'date': '2021-09-05', 'userId': 7115}, {'reviewiId': 2525154, 'score': 4.0, 'comment': None, 'date': '2022-03-05', 'userId': 10413}, {'reviewiId': 3422258, 'score': 3.0, 'comment': None, 'date': '2019-11-16', 'userId': 13582}, {'reviewiId': 2785842, 'score': 5.0, 'comment': None, 'date': '2024-06-28', 'userId': 11313}, {'reviewiId': 5099063, 'score': 5.0, 'comment': None, 'date': '2021-06-30', 'userId': 22632}, {'reviewiId': 5263539, 'score': 4.0, 'comment': None, 'date': '2021-10-21', 'userId': 23370}, {'reviewiId': 5295107, 'score': 4.0, 'comment': None, 'date': '2019-12-04', 'userId': 23600}, {'reviewiId': 5771464, 'score': 3.0, 'comment': None, 'date': '2023-11-18', 'userId': 26113}]",

231200,Early Madison Parish Louisiana Marriage Index Vol 2 1866-1900,,"The Hunting For Bears marriage data collection as of about 1980, covering 16 states, was bundled with Family Tree Maker(c) and sold in the tens of thousands and was crucial in making FTM(c) the most popular genealogical software in the world.

The same collection was included in Ancestry's(c) initial data searches, playing a significant role in its rise to the world's premier on line genealogy data search engine. 

That was the 1980 collection, the 2010 collection dwarfs it in comparison. This book is part of that 2010 collection. It is maintained in a data base structure to provide the highest information density. Each marriage is contained in one line. Each party in the union is included in the alphabetical listing. Using the records in a database format and listing both participants in the alphabetical sort was so unique in 1960 that the U.S. Government has granted Hunting For Bears a (c)copyright on the presentation in both electronic and print format.

When available, record location information such as county book and page number may be included as well as age, birth or death dates, race, gender and information about prior marriages. 

Several things we are considering in the immediate future are; e_books to buy, loan or free downloads, books available through instant publication, and books on line.

1494229,"Blind Spot: America and the Palestinians, from Balfour to Trump",2019,"A critical examination of the history of US-Palestinian relations The United States has invested billions of dollars and countless diplomatic hours in the pursuit of Israeli-Palestinian peace and a two-state solution. Yet American attempts to broker an end to the conflict have repeatedly come up short. At the center of these failures lay two critical factors: Israeli power and Palestinian politics. While both Israelis and Palestinians undoubtedly share much of the blame, one also cannot escape the role of the United States, as the sole mediator in the process, in these repeated failures. American peacemaking efforts ultimately ran aground as a result of Washington's unwillingness to confront Israel's ever-deepening occupation or to come to grips with the realities of internal Palestinian politics. In particular, the book looks at the interplay between the U.S.-led peace process and internal Palestinian politics--namely, how a badly flawed peace process helped to weaken Palestinian leaders and institutions and how an increasingly dysfunctional Palestinian leadership, in turn, hindered prospects for a diplomatic resolution. Thus, while the peace process was not necessarily doomed to fail, Washington's management of the process, with its built-in blind spot to Israeli power and Palestinian politics, made failure far more likely than a negotiated breakthrough. Shaped by the pressures of American domestic politics and the special relationship with Israel, Washington's distinctive ""blind spot"" to Israeli power and Palestinian politics has deep historical roots, dating back to the 1917 Balfour Declaration and the British Mandate. The size of the blind spot has varied over the years and from one administration to another, but it is always present.",English,[],925
