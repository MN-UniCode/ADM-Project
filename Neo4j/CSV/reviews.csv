1305751,4.0,"<p>Кумедний летектив. Може здатись трошки затягнутим, але в нього є своя атмосфера. <br />Розгадку я не відгалада аж до самого самого кінця. Авторка гарно відвернула увагу, і гортаючи знову, можна було таки здогадатись, хто саме винний. Але магія спрацювала.</p>",2020-06-23

1738872,5.0,"<p>A good mystery with a flawed group of people. I figured out the who before the end, so showing the flaws of the characters didn’t affect the solution. It did however make the book much more realistic. I can’t wait to get a hold off book two.</p>",2016-07-08

2771268,4.0,"<p>Such a good read. <br /><br />I struggled to get into the beginning of the book.  I was very intrigued but couldn’t picture where the story was going.  I’m happy i kept reading because it picked around the 100 page mark for me.  I loved chief inspector Gamache  as a character.  The mystery was sooo interesting that it kept me guessing.  The ending was not expected at all, but made son much sense.   I can’t wait to read the next book in the series.</p>",2023-12-18

4982040,3.0,"<p>Short Review: a small town murder in rural Canada. This was recommended to me by a friend because I really liked Bruno Chief of Police series. This series is a bit older and doesn’t spend quite as much time on food and wine, but is similar in feel. The characters are the focus and the crimes are real but the focus is telling the story, not leading the reader on a path. This seemed pretty straight forward but lead to a number of false leads before resolving itself. There is a clear back story to the book, so I assume the rest of the series will work on revealing that back story. There are now 10 books in the series so I have a ways to go. <br /><br /><br />My full review is on my blog at http://bookwi.se/still-life/<br /><br />I listened to the audiobook from Scribd. I am really liking the ebook/audiobook subscription service.  If you have not heard of it or are interested in my review it is http://bookwi.se/scribd-a-review/</p>",2015-01-09
