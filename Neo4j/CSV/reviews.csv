5977818,3.0,"<p>Bresson offers a collection of profound insights into the true essence of filmmaking. Bresson’s arguments about what cinema should strive to be are compelling, and his expectations for his models/actors shed light on his unique vision for film.<br /><br />His approach often depart from what mainstream filmmakers and general audiences typically appreciate. The challenge wasn’t rooted in style but in storytelling. Both Bresson and Tarkovsky advocated for filmmakers to push boundaries, experiment, and refine their craft by minimizing excess in favor of powerful imagery—creating pure visual storytelling.<br /><br />It’s essential reading, filled with invaluable notes for anyone passionate about film.</p>",2024-09-06

5767870,5.0,"<p>I absolutely adored On the Same Page, so it’s not surprise that I loved seeing more of Riley and Gianna. I absolutely loved the way this was structured; getting glimpses into their past experiences before seeing how those experiences shaped their futures really helped to maintain the feeling of the first book. Absolutely recommend to anyone who read the original!</p>",2024-09-12
