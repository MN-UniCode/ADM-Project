Bresson\u2019s arguments about what cinema should strive to be are compelling, and his expectations for his models\/actors shed light on his unique vision for film.<br \/><br \/>His approach often depart from what mainstream filmmakers and general audiences typically appreciate. The challenge wasn\u2019t rooted in style but in storytelling. Both Bresson and Tarkovsky advocated for filmmakers to push boundaries, experiment, and refine their craft by minimizing excess in favor of powerful imagery\u2014creating pure visual storytelling.<br \/><br \/>It\u2019s essential reading, filled with invaluable notes for anyone passionate about film.<\/p>",

I absolutely loved the way this was structured; getting glimpses into their past experiences before seeing how those experiences shaped their futures really helped to maintain the feeling of the first book. Absolutely recommend to anyone who read the original!<\/p>",
