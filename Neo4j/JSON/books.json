The challenge wasn\u2019t rooted in style but in storytelling. Both Bresson and Tarkovsky advocated for filmmakers to push boundaries, experiment, and refine their craft by minimizing excess in favor of powerful imagery\u2014creating pure visual storytelling.<br \/><br \/>It\u2019s essential reading, filled with invaluable notes for anyone passionate about film.<\/p>",
