                "comment":"<p>Short Review: a small town murder in rural Canada. This was recommended to me by a friend because I really liked Bruno Chief of Police series. This series is a bit older and doesn\u2019t spend quite as much time on food and wine, but is similar in feel. The characters are the focus and the crimes are real but the focus is telling the story, not leading the reader on a path. This seemed pretty straight forward but lead to a number of false leads before resolving itself. There is a clear back story to the book, so I assume the rest of the series will work on revealing that back story. There are now 10 books in the series so I have a ways to go. <br \/><br \/><br \/>My full review is on my blog at http:\/\/bookwi.se\/still-life\/<br \/><br \/>I listened to the audiobook from Scribd. I am really liking the ebook\/audiobook subscription service.  If you have not heard of it or are interested in my review it is http:\/\/bookwi.se\/scribd-a-review\/<\/p>",
