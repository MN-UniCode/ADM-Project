                "comment":"<p>This left me somewhat disappointed despite my initial excitement as a follower of the author. While the concept had promise for a compelling romance, the book fell short with a lack of a coherent plot and underdeveloped characters. The narrative felt non-linear, making it challenging to engage with the storyline. I could see that Madison must have been influenced by Sophie Lark and Elsie Silvers because I could see some similarities. <br \/><br \/>On a positive note, the curated playlist accompanying the book stood out, providing an enjoyable musical backdrop to the otherwise lackluster narrative of the book.<\/p>",

        "publicationYear":2024,
        "description":"A powerful examination of the unsettling history of photography and its fraught relationship to global antiblackness. Since photography\u2019s invention, black life has been presented as fraught, short, agonizingly filled with violence, and indifferent to intervention: living death\u2014mortevivum\u2014in a series of still frames that refuse a complex humanity. In Mortevivum, Kimberly Juanita Brown shows us how the visual logic of documentary photography and the cultural legacy of empire have come together to produce the understanding that blackness and suffering\u2014and death\u2014are inextricable. Brown traces this idea from the earliest images of the enslaved to the latest newspaper photographs of black bodies, from the United States and South Africa to Haiti and Rwanda, documenting the enduring, pernicious connection between photography and a global history of antiblackness. Photography's history, inextricably linked to colonialism and white supremacy, is a catalog of othering, surveillance, and the violence of objectification. In the genocide in Rwanda, for instance, photographs after the fact tell viewers that blackness comes with a corresponding violence that no human intervention can abate. In Haiti, the first black republic in the Western Hemisphere, photographic \u201cevidence\u201d of its sovereign failure suggests that the formerly enslaved cannot overthrow their masters and survive to tell the tale. And in South Africa and the United States, a loop of racial violence reminds black subjects of their lower-class status mandated via the state. Illustrating the global nature of antiblackness that pervades photographic archives of the present and the past, Mortevivum reveals how we live in a repetition of imagery signaling who lives and who dies on a gelatin silver print\u2014on a page in a book, on the cover of newspaper, and in the memory of millions.

        "description":"From the New York Times bestselling author of Red, White & Royal Blue comes a new romantic comedy that will stop readers in their tracks...\r\n\r\nFor cynical twenty-three-year-old August, moving to New York City is supposed to prove her right: that things like magic and cinematic love stories don\u2019t exist, and the only smart way to go through life is alone. She can\u2019t imagine how waiting tables at a 24-hour pancake diner and moving in with too many weird roommates could possibly change that. And there\u2019s certainly no chance of her subway commute being anything more than a daily trudge through boredom and electrical failures.\r\n\r\nBut then, there\u2019s this gorgeous girl on the train.\r\n\r\nJane. Dazzling, charming, mysterious, impossible Jane. Jane with her rough edges and swoopy hair and soft smile, showing up in a leather jacket to save August\u2019s day when she needed it most. August\u2019s subway crush becomes the best part of her day, but pretty soon, she discovers there\u2019s one big problem: Jane doesn\u2019t just look like an old school punk rocker. She\u2019s literally displaced in time from the 1970s, and August is going to have to use everything she tried to leave in her own past to help her. Maybe it\u2019s time to start believing in some things, after all.\r\n\r\nCasey McQuiston\u2019s One Last Stop is a magical, sexy, big-hearted romance where the impossible becomes possible as August does everything in her power to save the girl lost in time.",

The celebration of chosen family and the wonderful differences that span the human experience was so, so beautiful. <br \/><br \/>I came for the author of <i>Red, White, and Royal Blue<\/i> and the cute lesbian relationship, and I stayed for the whole sparkly cast of LGBTQ+ characters who shine in all of their own ways. So many of the characters could have been two-dimensional set pieces, but they weren\u2019t. This novel has so much <i>life<\/i> and celebration of community and queerness and belonging and love in all of its forms. I felt a lot of things while reading this, and in a way I felt like I sort of found a little piece of a home with its cast. Even though it was in NYC, where I have sworn I will never live. (My sister was in Flatbush for a little while and visiting was fun but I would not have wanted to stay.)<br \/><br \/>Anyway. I have no more words. I loved this book. It will now live in a chamber of my heart, where I will feed it with kind thoughts and fond memories and the occasional re-read.<\/p>",

                "comment":"<p>Books, Coffee &amp; Passion<br \/>August was a college student that just moved to New York, she was a loner and she was trying to make it on her own. She got a job and she managed to get a room in an apartment with three other roomates. The story truly begins to unfold when she meets a mysterious, gorgeous girl on the subway and can\u2019t stop thinking about her. <br \/><br \/>August was a very sweet character, really smart \u2013 her detective moments were so enjoyable. I liked her relationship, with its ups and downs, with her mom. It felt realistic. Her character growth was wonderful, the way she got more confortable with herself and how she connected with her roommates and Jane was genuinely entertaining.<br \/><br \/>Jane was very hot, very cool with her punk rock style and very, very interesting. I devoured the glimpses we got of her life, the 70s music, her life as a biracial lesbian in the 70s, etc. I think she was the most interesting character, so I wanted more of Jane at some moments. Considering her location, I get it was hard to have her on page as much as August but, regardless, I definitely wanted more of her. <br \/><br \/>I loved August and Jane together and I loved the found family aspect in this story too. AMAZING. The secondary characters stole my heart: Myla, Niko and Wes were EVERYTHING! I loved their interactions, loved their friendship, loved their relationships, loved them! I laughed a lot while listening to the audiobook. <br \/><br \/>Overall, One Last Stop felt unique, creative and refreshing. The scifi element in this book was very well done. However, the pacing was off at times, it felt like the book dragged for a bit especially at the beginning. Fortunately, it got better in the second half of the book and I still enjoyed it a lot. I wish we got a glimpse into the future of August and Jane\u2019s relationship, it would\u2019ve wrap up the story much better.<\/p>",

I loved all of the characters, August, Jane, August\u2019s roommates, coworkers, and her neighbor (her found family). And I loved the story, its such a fun and wild premise. This was funny, dramatic, and romantic. I didn\u2019t give it a full 5 stars because there were many points where I felt the book was going on for too long, some parts I skimmed because it didn\u2019t interest me but that\u2019s just a \u201cit\u2019s me not you thing\u201d. Casey McQuinston is a good writer and story teller, I hope this book becomes a graphic novel, it just feels like it would be beautiful to look in a visual medium.<\/p>",

How is written, the story, the characters, even the second characters have a story to follow and are interesting. I loved this book, beginning to ending.

The beginning and end of this are a fun, involving love story, however the middle third is a mess of improbable coincidences and people who only reveal things when it is convenient for plot.

I decided early on that I would read this book through the scope of my romance genre expectation lens instead of my sci-fi lens and I\u2019m glad I did because I finished on an extreme high. After a few days though, some of the minor letdowns became more apparent. I feel like the things I would change sound nit-picky, but I wanted the Jane reveal at Billy\u2019s to be bigger and more drawn out. The clich\u00e9 boom box at the window moment zoomed right by. I wanted the standoffishness of August at the beginning of the story to continue to be a part of her personality throughout. I wanted more emotion and autonomy out of Jane (it leaned a little too far into the white savior trope for my liking). I wanted more continuity with August\u2019s schooling and schedule balancing. That being said, I enjoyed this book as much as I wanted to while reading it. This is one of those books where you get lost in the scenery in your mind and can only recall scenes as if you watched them instead of read them. I wanted to be one of their roommates so badly. I will live in the service elevator in the Popeyes just to encounter Annie\/Isaiah. I want a whole book series on just the roommates. Great read.<\/p>",

Summer never ends.<br \/>Jane<\/i><br \/><br \/>\u2014<br \/><br \/>Well, if there\u2019s one thing Casey McQuiston knows how to do, it\u2019s fucking ruin me. She ruins me with perfect-written worlds, with the most wonderful characters, the sexiest smut, and genuinely fun and creative storylines where characters learn the most compelling things about themselves, things we know deep down and things that we need to be told every once in a while, to remind us that we are not alone. That learning through loves hurts, but it\u2019s so beautiful and necessary. <br \/><br \/>TL;DR: Casey McQuiston is a queer literary GOD and this book has left quite the mark on me. \u201cWe all have ghosts\u201d is a lesson I have learned and continue to learn, both in love and life in general, and this book was such an enjoyable, funny, quirky, smart, and genuinely romantic way of exploring that idea. The minute I picked it up, I couldn\u2019t put it down. Casey, you\u2019ve done it once again!<\/p>",

Wes was a silly little gay mess, Nico and Myla were absolutely adorable, Winfield and Lucie were surprisingly sweet and wholesome, and August and Jane of course were completely phenomenal. <br \/><br \/>August was such a complex character, and it was so clear how she\u2019d been shaped by the life she\u2019d lived, always searching for her uncle, and Jane was a delight - a fierce but loving character and the two of them just worked so well.<br \/><br \/>I found the story to be very well paced, allowing for Jane and August\u2019s relationship to develop not too slow but not too fast so that when Jane ends up gone it is utterly heart wrenching. But, of course, the author has it both ways, and Jane comes back (curse you Casey McQuiston for almost making me cry for no reason!) so you get both the crushing sorrow of Jane leaving and the overwhelming joy of her coming back. <br \/><br \/>I liked how the end of the book was just little anecdotes not properly part of the story. It anchored all of the other extra little snipets at the beginning of every chapter to the whole story and made the world feel even more full, because it felt like a conclusion, but August and Jane get to keep going.<br \/><br \/>This book was a fantastic read and I\u2019m definitely looking forward to reading more books by Casey McQuiston!<\/p>",

What stops this book from being as good as her first, is that McQuiston tries to do too much. Not only do you have time travel\/ghost mystery, you also have a long lost missing uncle mystery, a beloved local diner about to go out of business, and the side characters, while lovable, sometimes overwhelming everything.<br \/><br \/>If I were an editor on this, I would\u2019ve recommended to cut some stuff out. Like, for example, in the beginning one of August\u2019s roommates has a dog (a poodle named Noodles) and the dog is mentioned like one other time 2\/3s of the way into the book and never again. So what\u2019s the point?<br \/><br \/>I would not say that anything was a bad idea, but I think it could\u2019ve done without the long lost uncle. Just make the mom estranged from her family and that codependency being what August struggles with. You can have August really into true crime and doing detective stuff and if you sold it as something she was into on her own, it\u2019s a much more believable passion.<br \/><br \/>Just one or two more takes, is what I would suggest.<br \/><br \/>That being said I really did love this book. Jane Su is probably everyone\u2019s crush by the time they finish it.<\/p>",

                "comment":"<p>August Landry es una joven queer (bisexual) que ha escapado toda su vida de sus sentimientos, pertenece a ning\u00fan lado y con el coraz\u00f3n en la maleta se dirige a NY, nueva en la gran ciudad, pero no la vida, teniendo m\u00e1s experiencia de la que deber\u00eda a los 24 a\u00f1os, ella es el recuerdo tormentoso del hermano desaparecido de su madre, nacida de una esperanza delirante y de ser la compa\u00f1era de investigaci\u00f3n de su madre pasa a ser compa\u00f1era de piso de Niko, Myla, Wes y Noodles. <br \/><br \/>Al principio August se niega a abrirse a sus compa\u00f1eros, sin embargo, Niko parece ser m\u00e1s que un m\u00e9dium, enga\u00f1a bobos, y ve en ella un destino doloroso, pero maravilloso, el inicio de su gran camino comienza en la l\u00ednea del metro Q, donde conoce a Jane, y es ah\u00ed donde lo que Niko vio cobra sentido.<br \/>Su vergonzoso destino tuvo la alegr\u00eda de verla a punto de llorar, con el pecho lleno de caf\u00e9, con leche y con la impotencia contenida, cautiv\u00e1ndola en una mordida de labio, la frescura de un marzo regular fue la excusa perfecta para acercarse y ofrecerle una bufanda roja junto con una sonrisa c\u00e1lida, ese gesto dulce y el el\u00e9ctrico contacto al tocarse cuando iba a recibir la bufanda fue m\u00e1s que suficiente para que ambas comenzaran a frecuentar sus ma\u00f1anas con un saludo simple y una sonrisa de culpabilidad. <br \/><br \/>Este es un peque\u00f1o resumen de lo que es este maravilloso libro, nos entrega, las primeras p\u00e1ginas las devoras con tanta facilidad que no les resultar\u00e1 dif\u00edcil soltarlo, para m\u00ed fueron dos madrugadas llenas de emociones incontrolables, de risas a llanto, de esperanza, curiosidad, rabia y hasta amor.<br \/>Hablemos primero de los personajes, cada uno m\u00e1s carism\u00e1tico que el anterior, desprendiendo un atractivo alucinante, ninguno se siente fuera de lugar y hasta aprendes a quererlos tanto como August, con sus defectos y virtudes. <br \/>Luego tenemos la narraci\u00f3n impecable, dej\u00e1ndote siempre peque\u00f1as migajas del misterio que de repente se desencadena con la llegada de Jane Su, quien debo confesar que es mi personaje favorito, una lesbiana butch de los a\u00f1os 70\u2019 con la valent\u00eda de un gladiador y la dulzura de un infante, ella es lo mejor de ambos mundos, sacando de quicio a la mente brillante de August con su sonrisa ladeada y un brillo \u00fanico en su mirada.<br \/>August fue hecha para Jane, con 70 a\u00f1os de diferencia, Jane naci\u00f3 para August y la autora nos lo deja claro en todo momento, cada interacci\u00f3n que tienen es como una caricia a un alma herida, un romance genuino, lleno de esperanza, lleno de felicidad y hasta de dolor. No hay forma de amar sin dolor, el puro sentimiento viene con la amargura de la realidad, los pensamientos muchas veces nublan lo que el coraz\u00f3n desea. Ambas se deseaban con tanta intensidad que era imposible dejar que la neblina de la incertidumbre permaneciera muy lejos, sin embargo, con ellas aprendemos que no existen l\u00edmites cuando lo que nos conecta ha sido el destino.<\/p>",

Delightful to dive into, though I actually loved the \u201cfound family\u201d aspect more than I loved the romance itself. Even though I thought both Jane and August were great characters? But so were all August\u2019s roommates and friends (Niko\/Myla\/Wes, Isaiah\/Annie, her coworkers at the pancake place) - McQuiston is very good at writing fully fleshed-out characters. Parts of it were a tad overlong, but small complaint since I enjoyed this so much.<\/p>",

La\u2019ho fatto non per l\u2019hype che ha per il suo altro romanzo, ma perch\u00e9 ero genuinamente incuriosita da questo; cos\u00ec l\u2019ho letto senza grosse aspettative, ma con una vaga speranza che scaldasse un po\u2019 il mio cuore anti-romance.\u00a0<br \/><br \/>E diamine se ha superato le aspettative.\u00a0<br \/><br \/>E sapete che vi dico? La metafora con i pancake la faccio comunque. Perch\u00e9 \u00c8 come un piatto di pancakes di Billy\u2019s, o ancora meglio, il Su Special: \u00e8 buono, spettacolare e, anche se il gusto ti soddisfa pienamente, non \u00e8 abbastanza, ne vuoi ancora.<br \/>Casey McQuiston \u00e8 riuscit\u0259 a creare un ambiente confortevole e dei personaggi originali, interessanti, realistici.<br \/>\u00c8 impossibile per me andare avanti senza sapere qualcosa di pi\u00f9 su Wes e Isaiah, Myla e Niko, e tutti gli altri. Specie Augie (che mi \u00e8 proprio rimasto nel cuore).<br \/><br \/>Due sono le \u201cpecche\u201d del romanzo. Riassumibili in una frase: troppo poco.<br \/>Alcune parti sono state affrettate, optando per il raccontare le cose in modo frettoloso anzich\u00e9 mostrarle con la dovuta calma. E questo vale sia per gli avvenimenti che per i personaggi (no dico sul serio, mi leggerei un\u2019intera saga sulla vita di Augie e Jane).<br \/><br \/>Ma a parte questo, Ancora una fermata mi ha completamente rapita. Non riuscivo davvero a staccarmici (merito anche della lettrice dell\u2019audiolibro). E mi ha fatto desiderare di far parte della New York di August anche solo per una frazione di secondo; il tempo di un pancake da Billy\u2019s o uno spettacolo di Annie o un viaggio sulla linea Q.\u00a0<\/p>",

        "description":"From the Booker Prize-shortlisted author of Harvest, Quarantine, and Being Dead, a tender new novel about music, lost love, and the way barely whispered fears and desires push their way into the light. Alfred Busi lives alone in his villa overlooking the waves, with only his trusted piano for company. Famed in his town for his music and songs, he is mourning the recent death of his wife and quietly living out his days--occasionally performing the classics in small venues, though never in the stadiums he could fill when in his prime. On the night before receiving his town's highest honour, Busi is wrested from his bed by noises in his courtyard, and then stunned by an attacking intruder. His hands and neck are scratched, and his face is bitten. Busi can't say what it was that he encountered, exactly, but he feels his assailant was neither man nor animal. The attack sets off a chain of events that will cast a shadow on Busi's career, imperil his home, and alter the fabric of his town. Busi's own account of what happened is embellished to fan the flames of old rumour--of an ancient race of people living in the surrounding forest--and to spark new controversy: something must finally be done about the town's poor, the feral vegabonds whose numbers have been growing. Meanwhile Busi, weathering a media storm, must come to terms with his wife's death and decide whether to sing one last time. The Melody is a story about grief and aging, about reputation and its loss, and the peculiar way myth seeps into real life. In trademark crystalline prose, Jim Crace portrays a man taking stock of his life and looking into an uncertain future, all while bearing witness to a community in the throes of great change--with echoes of today's most pressing social questions.",

This book is a fantastic guide to understanding the essential facets of astrology. The author begins by explaining that your birth chart is a snapshot of the positions of the planets at the moment you were born. With this understanding, she then guides you as you learn to interpret seemingly complex astrological information with ease. <br \/><br \/>One thing that immediately caught my attention was the stunning cover on this book. It certainly carries on into the book with brilliant illustrations that add value to each section. I found it well laid out and easy to follow, making it perfect for newbies like me! The workbook is chock full of information about astrology and all the different signs, planets, etc., which makes it an excellent resource for those interested in learning more about themselves or others.<br \/><br \/>Overall, Stefanie Caponi\u2019s Guided Astrology Workbook is a must-read for anyone looking to expand their knowledge of astrology or discover more about themselves. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking insight and clarity in their lives. After reading this digital version, I am definitely buying myself a physical copy!<br \/><br \/><strong>ARC Via NetGalley<\/strong><\/p>",

A high-school dropout struggles through the labyrinthine college admissions process as he is reluctantly drawn into the breakdown of his parents' toxic marriage. A recovering addict finds out on Facebook that his best friend is dead; a college freshman accidentally comes across his high-school girlfriend on a porn site. Set against a backdrop of abandoned factories, faceless strip malls, and suburban alienation, these unsettling and deceptively simple visions of post-industrial despair capture the ambivalence and innocence of a generation coming to terms with a fundamentally stagnant world.",

So returning to London after seven months' seclusion may have been a mistake. Alec's foreboding deepens when a nobody vicar drops dead at a party-political dinner; he witnesses the very public humiliation of an up-and-coming portrait painter, and his rabble-rousing uncle Plantagenet is bashed and left for dead in a laneway. When the vicar's true identity is revealed, Alec suspects the man was poisoned. But who would want a seemingly harmless man of God murdered, and why?ALEC HALSEY MYSTERY series book 2Character-driven amateur sleuthNon explicit (mild violence)Story length 102,000 wordsREVIEWSLucinda Brant is the queen of Georgian Historical Mystery just as Georgette Heyer was the queen of Regency Romance. What these two authors have in common, besides being superb writers, is their ability to weave historical information into the plot so that the reader is transported effortlessly to another time and place. Lucinda Brant gets 5 stars from me, and I can't wait to read the other books in the Alec Halsey series! Anne B for Readers' FavoriteLucinda Brant has a beautiful writing style and a careful grasp on the social mores, political environment and tangled affairs of the aristocracy of Georgian England. Her characterizations are layered and complex. The mystery is intricately woven into an absorbing plot. Lucinda Brant is a gifted writer and Deadly Affair is highly and enthusiastically recommended for lovers of historical mysteries! Jill MacKenzie InD'Tale magazine",

I would recommend this book to anyone, but people who grew up on the waterfront will particularly connect with it.  There were plenty of \u201chuman condition\u201d themes to tap into which makes this a good book to teach to a mature seventh or eighth grade class.  I will read this book again someday.<\/p>",

        "publicationYear":2015,
        "description":"Non tutti hanno la capacit\u00e0 immediata di comprendere fino in fondo i segreti della montagna. Vedono le cime come blocchi turriti, pilastri di roccia scabri e senza valore, ammassi di pietre inutili sorti qua e l\u00e0 per capriccio del tempo. Basta, per\u00f2, alzare lo sguardo ed essere sovrastati dall'imponenza del mare verticale, con i suoi milioni di granelli di sabbia, per sentire nascere lo stupore. Lo stupore che genera domande. Le domande che generano misteri: chi ci sar\u00e0 lass\u00f9? Vi abita qualcuno? E, se esiste, come sar\u00e0 fatto? Nei boschi, tra le rocce, dentro l'alba, sotto le foglie, sulle vette ancora inesplorate. L\u00ec dormono i segreti della montagna. E Mauro Corona ci accompagna ancora una volta a scoprirli, tendendoci la mano, aiutandoci a salire. Ci esorta a giocare con il rimbalzo dell'eco, che vuole sempre l'ultima parola, ad ascoltare la voce del vento, che non sapremo mai da dove nasce. Ci conduce lungo i ruscelli a spiare le ninfe dai lunghi capelli d'acqua, ci indica il sentiero per raggiungere il grande abete bianco - adagiando l'orecchio al tronco, sentiremo il suo cuore battere. La montagna \u00e8 viva, ha cinque sensi protesi a conoscere il mondo. E come tutti gli esseri speciali ha anche un senso in pi\u00f9: la percezione. Grazie a lei, pu\u00f2 scoprire in anticipo le barbare intenzioni dei politici che vogliono ferirla, strizzarla, spremerla fino a distruggerla, pur di incassare moneta sonante. Ma la montagna resiste, perch\u00e9 ha un compito pi\u00f9 grande: \u00e8 stata creata affinch\u00e9 possiamo scrutare la nostra anima e diventare migliori. Scoprirla \u00e8 scoprirsi. E se, in solitudine, saremo capaci di avvertire le presenze nascoste nel buio, avremo fatto il passo decisivo per capire che inseguire i misteri della montagna non vuol dire nient'altro che ricercare noi stessi, andando alle origini delle nostre paure. Il tempo delle curiosit\u00e0 non ha scadenza, dobbiamo solo farci trovare pronti per questa nuova, indimenticabile, avventura.",

Most brief experiences capable of making a long-lasting impact involve obvious changes in one's outward circumstances, like a birth, a death, a marriage, or an illness. Yet some life-changing moments seem to come wholly from another source, appearing as mental states or altered states of consciousness either from deep within a person's mind or, perhaps, from a source beyond the self. These experiences have been called by different names over time: spiritual, religious, mystical, peak, or self-transcendent, and people around the world and throughout history have experienced them, up to and including the present day. The sacred texts of every major religion describe these moments, philosophers since the ancient Greeks have pondered them, and according to recent Gallup polls (2003), well over 30% of contemporary Americans have experienced them\"--",

Dick to have been the greatest science fiction writer on any planet. Since his untimely death in 1982, interest in Dick's works has continued to mount and his reputation has been enhanced by a growing body of critical attention. The Philip K. Dick Award is now presented annually to a distinguished work of science fiction, and the Philip K. Dick Society is devoted to the study and promulgation of his works. This collection includes all of the writer's earliest short and medium-length fiction covering the years 1954-1964, and featuring such fascinating tales as The Minority Report (the inspiration for Steven Spielberg's film), Service Call, Stand-By, The Days of Perky Pat, and many others. Here, readers will find Dick's initial explorations of the themes he so brilliantly brought to life in his later work. Dick won the prestigious Hugo Award for the best novel of 1963 for The Man in the High Castle. In the last year of his life, the film Blade Runner was made from his novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? The classic stories of Philip K. Dick offer an intriguing glimpse into the imagination of one of science fiction's most enduring and respected names. \"A useful acquisition for any serious SF library or collection.\" --Kirkus Reviews \"Awe-inspiring.\" --The Washington Post",

        "publicationYear":2014,
        "description":"HOW TO WIN THE LOTTERY WITH THE LAW OF ATTRACTION was written by Law of Attraction lottery winner, teacher and author Eddie Coronado. Based on interviews with actual winners who have used the Law of Attraction to win lottery prizes, this book provides the metaphysical tools and insights that are necessary to win lottery and contest prizes through the creative power of thoughts and feelings. Although this book contains the manifestation techniques of people who have won money, these metaphysical exercises can be used to attract the perfect mate, a new career, financial success, or anything that you can make a part of your beliefs and feelings. There is no limit to how much money and success you can manifest through the Law of Attraction because this immense spiritual power does not have an opinion about what you should or should not have. You can use the Law of Attraction to manifest ten cents or ten million dollars. The determining factor is belief and expectancy, which can be harnessed by using the spiritual tools discussed in this book.THIS BOOK CONTAINS FOUR PARTS:PART 1: This section explores the tools that are used for the manifestation techniques in this book. The tools covered are as follows: Affirmations, Creative Visualization, Expectation, Gratitude, and the Practice of Receiving. You should take the time to carefully read this section even if you are familiar with the Law of Attraction and the power of intention. This section contains a number of insights and explanations that may have been missed by other authors and teachers. For example, the Practice of Receiving is a powerful tool that can help you attract a lot of money, yet many Law of Attraction books do not mention this important exercise. In addition, I have included some helpful information about gratitude and affirmations as it relates to manifesting money. Affirmations of words, thoughts, feelings, and actions are also covered. Finally, the most important element of any manifestation technique is creative visualization, which every Law of Attraction lottery and contest winner has used to win prizes.PART 2: This section includes the manifestation techniques used by the winners who were interviewed for this book. Each winner, including the author, is introduced and his\/her manifestation exercise is documented to reflect the exact steps taken to win lottery prizes. No changes have been made in order to preserve the integrity of each winner's method.PART 3: This is a Question and Answer Section that covers the most important questions about the manifestation techniques in this book. The answers have been provided by the lottery winners who were interviewed. This Question and Answer section will provide clarity and direction for those readers who are committed to using the Law of Attraction to manifest lottery prizes. The questions included in this section cover topics such as: Should I buy lots of tickets? How will I know that my intention will work? How long will it take for me to get results? What part does luck play in manifesting lottery prizes? In addition, a host of other important questions are discussed. PART 4: This section contains helpful tips and suggestions that will explain how to implement the following manifestation techniques and how to make the most of them. It also contains information regarding the common denominators of the winners' daily action plan in order to provide a clear understanding of the mental and emotional habits that are necessary for manifesting lottery prizes with the Law of Attraction.",

Their obsession with Taiwanese food and culture propelled them to open Win Son together in 2016. The East Williamsburg restaurant quickly established itself as a destination and often incurs long waits for their vibrant and flavorful Taiwanese-American cuisine. Ku and Brown have teamed up with Cathy Erway, Taiwanese food expert and celebrated writer, to create this book which explores and celebrates the cuisine of Taiwan and its ever-simmering pot of creative influences. Told through the eyes, taste buds, travels, and busy lives of Ku, Brown, and Erway, this book brings the cuisine of this misunderstood island nation into the spotlight. With 100 creative, yet accessible recipes, this book will unravel the history of this diaspora cuisine. While featuring classic dishes and well-known favorites, this cookbook also stretches this cuisine's definition, introducing new dishes with brazen twists that are fun, flavorful, and decidedly American-born in style.",

        "publicationYear":2015,
        "description":"As Harvard Business School professor and business executive Robert Steven Kaplan explains in this new book, leadership is accessible to all of us-today-and it starts with an ownership mind-set. You don't need an invitation to lead. Leadership is a dynamic way of thinking and acting that anyone can take on. For Kaplan, acting as a leader is a function of three key questions: 1. Do you work to figure out what you believe as if you were an owner? 2. Do you take action based on those beliefs? 3. Do you focus on adding value to others and take responsibility for the impact of your actions on others-both positive and negative? The book is full of stories taken from the author's own leadership experience as well as from his work helping various types of leaders and organizations. What's revealed is that leadership is not a role reserved for an elite few blessed with the right skills and key positions-it's about a focus on taking ownership and adding value to others. What's more, leadership is a lifelong journey of learning for which you must take responsibility. It's about learning to ask the right questions and learning to understand yourself. As in his earlier books, Kaplan asks probing questions, provides exercises, and suggests follow-up steps that will help you develop your skills, create new habits, and move you toward reaching your unique potential. What You Really Need to Lead is your key to unlocking the power of thinking and acting like an owner\"--",

In the case of this book, I somehow found it charming\u2026go figure. On top of that, the scene where they go to the biker compound made me laugh my ass off for ten minutes straight. I sincerely hope Hannah is getting her own book! It was also well written and well paced. As I said, the hero was a virgin. The heroine was NOT. There was no OW\/OM drama. There were hot sex scenes. There was humor. Great secondary characters (the couple from book one and Hannah). Two very likable main characters. I ADORED Nate. Who doesn\u2019t love a hot sexy cop? And Tillie was just as endearing. Lastly, it was all wrapped up in a sweet little epilogue. Two HUGE thumbs up from yours truly.<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>",

        "description":"It's OK to be angry about capitalism. It's OK to want something better. Bernie Sanders takes on the 1% and speaks blunt truths about a system that is fuelled by uncontrolled greed, and rigged against ordinary people. Where a handful of oligarchs have never had it so good, with more money than they could spend in a thousand lifetimes, and the vast majority struggle to survive. Where a decent standard of living for all seems like an impossible dream. How can we accept an economic order that allows three billionaires to control more wealth than the bottom half of our society? How can we accept a political system that allows the super-rich to buy elections and politicians? How can we accept an energy system that rewards the fossil fuel corporations causing the climate crisis? How can we let it happen any longer? We must demand fundamental economic and political change. This is where the path forward begins. It's OK To Be Angry About Capitalism presents a vision of what would be possible if the political revolution took place. If we would finally recognize that economic rights are human rights, and work to create a society that provides them. This isn't some utopian fantasy; this is democracy as we should know it. Is it really too much to ask?",

        "description":"A Clockwork Orange is a dystopian satirical black comedy novel by English writer Anthony Burgess, published in 1962. It is set in a near-future society that has a youth subculture of extreme violence. The teenage protagonist, Alex, narrates his violent exploits and his experiences with state authorities intent on reforming him. The book is partially written in a Russian-influenced argot called \"Nadsat\", which takes its name from the Russian suffix that is equivalent to '-teen' in English. According to Burgess, it was a jeu d'esprit written in just three weeks.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, A Clockwork Orange was included on Time magazine's list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923, and it was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. The original manuscript of the book has been kept at McMaster University's William Ready Division of Archives and Research Collections in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada since the institution purchased the documents in 1971. It is considered one of the most influential dystopian books.\r\n\r\n----------\t\t\r\nAlso contained in:\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n[A Clockwork Orange \/ The Wanting Seed](https:\/\/openlibrary.org\/works\/OL17306508W)",

I would have liked more about the root witch but I can appreciate why we didn\u2019t get any (why would WE get answers when the characters didn\u2019t).<\/p>",

Contudo, Laurentino poderia ser mais organizado com um racioc\u00ednio mais linear. <br \/>Outro problema \u00e9 a mistura entre fatos e suposi\u00e7\u00f5es, isso poderia estar mais delimitado, e conseguiria, portanto, deixar o leitor curioso sobre determinados assuntos. Al\u00e9m disso, das diversas hist\u00f3rias narradas, algumas apesar de interessantes, n\u00e3o comp\u00f5e um todo. N\u00e3o parece em nenhum momento que o autor est\u00e1 formando uma hist\u00f3ria concisa pra chegar at\u00e9 o final. Comparando-se com o livro anterior, isso caiu bastante na qualidade. Quem sabe, deve-se ler este livro como se fosse os cap\u00edtulos intermedi\u00e1rios de um \u00fanico livro. <br \/>No mais, Laurentino segue no mesmo estilo. Narra uma hist\u00f3ria principal recheadas de curiosidades ir\u00f4nicas (algumas terr\u00edveis, mostrando que escravos nunca foram tratados com flores) para contar numa mesa de bar, mas poucos fatos que contribuem de forma significativa para um debate mais rico.<br \/>Espero que terceiro seja mais objetivo e foque na \u201ccontribui\u00e7\u00e3o\u201d da escravid\u00e3o na forma\u00e7\u00e3o do Brasil - sim, j\u00e1 h\u00e1 muitas informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre como cultura negra brasileira permeia nosso pa\u00eds, contudo, as rela\u00e7\u00f5es pol\u00edticas de poder ainda est\u00e3o fora de cena.<br \/><br \/>OBS: Eu n\u00e3o queria avaliar 3\/5, visto que trata de uma hist\u00f3ria quase que esquecida\/quase n\u00e3o falada nos col\u00e9gios.<\/p>",

Plus you can pick up it up for free on audible (at least at time of this review) so no reason not to check it out.<\/td>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/tbody>\n<\/table>",

His adoptive father couldn\u2019t see past his inability to speak clearly and to do \u201cguy\u201d things. He abandoned Moojie to the cranky care of his grandfather, a hillbilly who ran a dairy farm. Moojie grew up angry and his longing for a real family became more crippling than his physical handicaps.<br \/><br \/>Pappy got Moojie exercising and  then saddled him with chores and work around the farm to do. Slowly Moojie learned to speak, walk with braces, and use his hand for the chores. His chores gave him the opportunity to explore the hills around the farm, and there he met The Lighteaters. This clan of loveable misfits are the sworn enemies of his Pappy and the townfolk who call them The Hostiles.<br \/><br \/>Moojie longed to become part of the Lighteater clan, but they wouldn\u2019t accept him until he learned to live by The Code. Through his improbable adventures, Moojie learned the power of mercy, charity, forgiveness, and love.<br \/><br \/>This is a quirky, funny, and touching story that will surprise and delight you. I highly recommend it!<\/p>",

        "description":"How business leaders can move their DEI efforts from intention to impact through strategy and culture change. In the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s murder, corporate America has doubled down on its public intentions to be more inclusive and equitable. Yet beyond the pledges it is difficult to see which system changes make a real difference. In From Intention to Impact, Malia Lazu draws on her background as a community organizer, her corporate career as a bank president, and now her experience as a leading DEI consultant to explain what has been holding organizations back and what they need to do better. First and foremost, she recognizes that truly moving from intention to impact means targeting and changing the traditions and culture that normalize whiteness. From Intention to Impact shows what organizations, leaders, and people at all levels must do to create more inclusive environments that honor and value diversity. Lazu shares a seven-stage guide through this process as well as a 3L model of listening, learning, and loving that readers can use from the initial excitement of doing \u201csomething\u201d to the frustration when the inevitable pushback comes, and finally to the determination to do the hard work despite the challenges\u2014on corporate and political fronts. Most compelling, From Intention to Impact shows that, while commitment from the top is paramount, for DEI to be most effective, it needs to be decentralized\u2014among managers, within teams, and across the organization. A crucial read for anyone looking to future-proof their company, From Intention to Impact goes beyond the \u201cfeel good\u201d PR-centric actions to showcase the real DEI work that must be done to create true and lasting systemic change.",

Now, years later, when infertility prevents her from giving her ambitious attorney husband a family, she finds herself on the brink of divorce, unemployed, and living with her right-wing, born-again Christian parents in her suburban New Jersey hometown. There the schools are private, the past is public, and blessings come in lump sums. Then Ellen meets a man to whom she believes she can open her heart, and she begins to think that maybe it's true that everything happens for a reason--until all that was going well starts going very badly and Ellen is finally forced to dig deep to find her own brand of faith\"--",

        "description":"In the days when the presence of a computer did NOT presume the presence of a network (they used to be freestanding units that could not easily communicate with another system), accounts to use the computer were expensive to maintain and heavily scrutinized by management.  When the Accounting staff of Stoll's university employer discovered 75 cents' worth of time used with which no user was associated, they called him and demanded that he locate the \"phantom\" user.  Stoll wasn't even a computing pro - he was an astronomer that used the computer to run programs that pointed telescopes properly.  But he was a member of a club that exists today - that person elected to do network administration because he drew the short straw.  Stoll tells the ensuing circa 1985 tale of analysis when people worldwide were only just discovering what networks could reveal... and hide.  Rather like today.",

                "comment":"<p>I\u2019m usually super into tales about the early days of computers, technology, the internet, and gaming, but I think this one was a miss for me. The author was an astrophysics student at UC Berkeley who accidentally discovers a hacker while trying to explain a 75 cent(!!!) discrepancy in the computer time books. Rather than shut the guy out, Stoll spends months meticulously tracking the hacker\u2019s moves through the early \u2018net and creating a web of connections within basically every letter agency active at the time. Nobody wants to be the one agency to act, so there\u2019s a lot of back-and-forth between agencies at various points of the book, until someone finally loses patience, blinks, and the hacker gets caught.<br \/><br \/>I had a few issues with the book. I understand it\u2019s basically a computer period piece of how technology was at the time, but it still got super repetitive about halfway through. The beginning was really interesting, the end was similarly compelling, but the middle was basically a series of \u201cI see the hacker in my systems, here\u2019s what he\u2019s doing, I wish I could stop him\u201d short segments. I also was mildly annoyed at the author\u2019s massive Main Character Syndrome, where he turns the hacker information over to the proper authorities, and then gets all shocked\/angry\/annoyed at not being immediately privvy to whatever the government does with the information. Long segments of the book are dedicated to the author waxing philosophical about how he\u2019s working with The Man and how much he hates not knowing what\u2019s going on. It gets kind of annoying.<br \/><br \/>I did like the glimpse into the computer technology from the period, though. I liked reading about the innovative ways the author used to track the hacker, determine his location, and mess with him to keep him on the line long enough to be traced. Well done in that respect.<br \/><br \/>Just kind of a mixed bag of a book all around, honestly.<\/p>",

I have for as long as I can remember being interested in computers. Somehow I had never managed to read this book. <br \/><br \/>I\u2019m glad I finally got around to it. It might be my new favorite. Cliff Stoll tells an engaging and personal story of his discovery of computer networks, security exploits and computer crime that reads more like a spy novel than a technical manual.<br \/><br \/>I think Mr. Stoll does a good job of making things easy to understand for the non-technical person. It has just enough detail to follow the story without being overwhelming. Of course being a computer person myself, I may not be the best to judge how technical this book gets.<br \/><br \/>This book overlaps with some other stories of computer crime I\u2019ve read and re-sparked my interest in reading some others I have on my backlog, along with rereading one I read back in high school that seems to overlap with this one a bit.<br \/><br \/>It\u2019s hard for me to judge how non-techies will enjoy this book, but anyone who wants to see what things were like in the early days of the internet should find this fascinating.<br \/><br \/>The most remarkable thing was how little the various law enforcement agencies seemed to care. It was really the wild-wild west of computer crime. To the FBI, unless they physically stole something, destroyed something or cost your millions of dollars, it wasn\u2019t worth pursuing.<br \/><br \/>How do you quantify computer time? Especially back then when computers weren\u2019t affordable and resources were limited. What about the time Cliff Stoll spend tracking the hacker? Time he should have spent doing his job. Everyone wanted him to keep at, and to keep them in the loop, but no one was willing to do anything about it, or cough up funds to support him.<br \/><br \/>It would take a few more years and some bigger crimes to finally wake them up and change how computer crime ranked in importance. Then again, most people are inundated with malware, spyware, viruses, scams and phishing emails on an almost daily basis. So in some ways it feels like nothing has really changed. You\u2019re not going to call the FBI because someone tried to steal your password.<br \/><br \/>Computer crime is big business these days, and if you want to see how it was in the early days, this is a must read.<\/p>",

                "comment":"<p><br \/><br \/> <br \/><br \/>Pretty good cover on this one. A good representation of the hero. Good composition as well. The font used for the title is a bit too thin (IMO) which makes it a bit hard to read. <br \/><br \/>I enjoyed this one for the most part. It was a bit slow and repetitive at times, but overall it wasn\u2019t a bad read. The writing was good. The pace as I said was a bit too slow for me. The plot was engaging. It wasn\u2019t very angsty and had no OW\/OM drama. Although the hero does go to the BDSM club and makes plans with a sub there, he realizes it doesn\u2019t feel right and ends the scene. There are also flashback sex scenes of when she was being held captive. There was only a single sex scene between the hero\/heroine that takes place at 75% into the book. But it was a very emotional and poignant scene that brought tears to my eyes.<br \/><br \/> <br \/><br \/>There was a nice collection of secondary characters (couples from previous books). And both main characters were likable. Donovan had the patience of a saint, and I really liked him. Although I would have preferred the book had moved a bit quicker so we would have gotten more time spent with Donovan in DOM mode. Phebe was also quite a good heroine. My heart broke for her, but she was strong and determined to take her life back. I loved whenever she called Donovan out on him treating her like she was going to break. Lastly, it was all wrapped up in a short and sweet epilogue. This one gets a solid thumbs up from yours truly.<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>",

Jane es la persona que August sue\u00f1a encontrarse en el vag\u00f3n del metro d\u00eda tras d\u00eda. Pero pronto se topa con un gran problema: Jane no solo parece una punk de los setenta, lo es. Est\u00e1 atrapada en esa l\u00ednea de metro y August tendr\u00e1 que utilizar todo lo que ha intentado dejar atr\u00e1s para ayudarla. Despu\u00e9s de todo, quiz\u00e1s haya llegado el momento de empezar a creer en ciertas cosas.",

Rimasto solo, Rigg scoprir\u00e0 tuttavia che il genitore gli ha tenuto nascoste molte altre cose riguardanti il suo potere, il suo passato, la sua identit\u00e0. E soprattutto il suo destino. Perch\u00e9 Rigg non pu\u00f2 semplicemente conoscere ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 stato, ha anche il potere di cambiarlo. A questo punto la minaccia pi\u00f9 pericolosa arriva dal futuro: Rigg scopre infatti di essere una pedina cruciale nella lotta tra due fazioni, tra chi lo vuole re e chi lo vuole morto. Per salvarsi, dovr\u00e0 mettere in discussione tutto ci\u00f2 che crede di sapere, dare fondo a tutto il suo talento e soprattutto assumere il controllo della propria sorte.",

        "description":"Sara Daniele Rivera\u2019s award-winning debut is a collection of sprawling elegy in the face of catastrophic grief, both personal and public. From the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election through the COVID-19 pandemic, these poems memorialize lost loved ones and meditate on the not-yet gone\u2014all while the wider-world loses its sense of connection, safety, and assurance. In those years of mourning, The Blue Mimes is a book of grounding and heartening resolve, even and especially in the states of uncertainty that define the human condition. Rivera\u2019s poems travel between Albuquerque, Lima, and Havana, deserts and coastlines and cities, Spanish and English\u2014between modes of language and culture that shape the contours of memory and expose the fault lines of the self. In those inevitable fractures, with honest, off-kilter precision, Rivera vividly renders the ways in which the bereft become approximations of themselves as a means of survival, mimicking the stilted actions of the people they once were. Where speech is not enough, this astonishing collection finds a radical practice in continued searching, endurance without promise\u2014the rifts in communion and incomplete pictures that afford the possibility to heal.",

                "comment":"<p>Disclaimer: I received an eARC from netgalley.com in exchange for my review.<br \/><br \/>I\u2019ve read a few Amanda Hocking books. Each one has a compelling world. Her new \u201cValkyrie\u201d series is no different. Imagine a world where the supernatural, global god pantheons (in this book, it heavily relies on the Norse pantheon), and technology come alive, peacefully coexisting with their own rules and regulations. This is the world Hocking drops us into. I\u2019m such a geek for magic and technology; Shadowrun the RPG being one of my all-time favorite game settings. So, I was pleasantly squeeing when I dove into this book.<br \/><br \/>In Between the Blade and the Heart, we\u2019re introduced to Malin, a Valkyrie-in-training. She\u2019s just come back from her latest assignment to find an intruder in her apartment. And thus, starts the quest that leads us through the rest of the story, that takes her through her city, pushing her past what she thought was the truth about her vocation, and deep into Mexico.<br \/><br \/>Hocking does a great job of building her books. The world feels real, her characters are wonderfully flawed, and they feel real wandering around their setting. This new series is fast paced, contains a great bi-love triangle (about time!), and leaves us with a cliff-hanger that I didn\u2019t see coming (too much). It also contains the cutest little pet critter I\u2019ve ever read in a book (Malin, if you read this\u2026 I\u2019d be more than happy to take care of Bowie any time). <br \/><br \/>If you like your urban fantasy with a mythical twist, some cool technology, and a bunch of kick-ass heroines, then give Between the Blade and the Heart a read. Eagerly awaiting book two!<\/p>",

                "comment":"<p>Between the Blade and the Heart (Valkyrie #1) is a brand-new series by Amanda Hocking that is based on Norse Mythology and more specifically the training of a young Valkyrie who discovers that her life and all she believed was twisted lies and hidden agendas.\u00a0 I have to admit when this first came on to Netgalley it reminded me a little bit of Lost Girl the show I couldn\u2019t get enough of that show so I could not wait to read it.  This was easy entertaining and fast paced and a series I will definitely continue. While this is not my first book by Amanda Hocking this is the first book by her that will be getting a 4 star rating. I found the concept well thought out but my connection with the characters just did not happen the way I would have liked\u2026 That being said I loved the end it left me curious and wanting more. All and all I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get lost in a beautifully written fantasy and doesn\u2019t mind a cliff hanger because this book has one. Thank you to all parties that made it possible for me arc. I really did enjoy this book.<\/p>",

Brendan O'Carroll takes readers back to the heart of working-class Dublin, this time in the 1940s. Together with her soon to be lifelong best friend Marion Delany, young Agnes manages to survive the indignities and demands of Catholic school, the unwanted births of siblings, days spent in the factories and markets, and nights in the dance hall as rock-and-roll invades Dublin. But on the eve of her wedding night, the Jarro is alive with gossip\u2014will Agnes be turned away at the altar? For the whole parish knows Agnes's not-so-well-kept secret. And with a mother falling further into dementia, and a younger sister turning to a life of crime, it's up to Agnes alone to keep her splintering family together, while trying to create one of her own. Filled with O'Carroll's trademark wicked wit and loving, larger-than-life characters, The Young Wan shows the hardscrabble beginnings of the ultimate Irish mother and family.",

She knows better than to give in, even when her old best friend shows up in town again\u2014and they have the same spark as ever.\n\nOf course, it doesn\u2019t help that Brooke is bisexual, single, and the entirety of Mountain Crossing is intent on the two of them getting together.\n\nSilent Night is a 35,000-word sweet small-town childhood-friends-to-lovers Christmas romance novella, following a musician with auditory processing disorder who just wants some peace and quiet, and her childhood best friend who\u2019s a happy small-town baker and painter.

For instance, when the character of Fawbry is first introduced, I read and re-read that sentence multiple times trying to decide what the heck was going on. <i>\u201cFawbry, she had said, was a minor nuisance in Terrgar.\u201d<\/i><br \/><br \/>Maybe it was just me (I know I can be a mite dense sometimes) but I just didn\u2019t get that Fawbry was a character name, not a place name. I read it as a city that was causing trouble for a country, but knew that couldn\u2019t be right (contextually speaking.)   I am glad that I stuck with it though, because it wasn\u2019t much past 6% into the novel when the story started to resonate for me. It wasn\u2019t until much later that I realized that I felt much the same about this story as I had when reading C.J. Cherryh\u2019s [b:The Morgaine Saga<\/td>\n      <td>57040<\/td>\n      <td>The Morgaine Saga (Morgaine Saga, Books 1, 2, and 3)<\/td>\n      <td>C.J. Cherryh<\/td>\n      <td>http:\/\/photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1170461551s\/57040.jpg<\/td>\n      <td>55568]. And that\u2019s a pretty good compliment, in my opinion. <br \/><br \/>Malja is one of those cool and conflicted characters that, like Drizzt Do\u2019Urden, probably isn\u2019t very realistic and probably wouldn\u2019t be fun to hang out with in reality, but she sure is a blast to read as she slices and dices her way through the men and beasts standing in her way. The fact that she isn\u2019t invulnerable physically, just makes the stakes that much more interesting. Oh, and her damned-to-fail attempts to protect her mute ward from using his special skills, yeah\u2026 so sad. So fun to read.<br \/><br \/>So, basically, if you like moody, ambient fantasy\/post-apocalyptic smashups, then this is right up your alley.<\/td>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/tbody>\n<\/table>",

In the summer, Hugh explores uses for berries, offering recipes for blackberry vinegar, pickled blueberries, and raspberry cobbler with drop biscuits. Beautifully written, this book brings fresh produce to the center of your plate. It's what both your doctor and your grocery bill have been telling you to do, and Hugh gives us the knowledge and the inspiration to wrap ourselves around produce in new ways.",

Mas, para falar a verdade, minha experi\u00eancia de ler esse livro foi muito impactado (e aperfei\u00e7oado) pela a c\u00f3pia espec\u00edfica que eu li. Eu ganhei de presente a s\u00e9rie inteira com todos os desenhos e uma capa muita bonita. Esse estilo elevado combinou muito bem com a nostalgia da hist\u00f3ria e at\u00e9 o jeito que C.S. Lewis escreve. As palavras, ideias, e personagens foram tudo muito da d\u00e9cada 40 ou 50. Amei a experi\u00eancia com esse livro, mas mesmo n\u00e3o lendo uma edi\u00e7\u00e3o luxo assim, a hist\u00f3ria vale muito a pena! <br \/><br \/>Faixa et\u00e1ria recomendada: 7+<br \/>Eu indicaria esse livro para qualquer crian\u00e7a que consegue l\u00ea-lo. Na minha mente, n\u00e3o tem nenhuma preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o sobre conte\u00fado. Ali\u00e1s, indicaria esse livro tamb\u00e9m para qualquer adulto que nunca tenha lido!<\/p>",

Lili and Esti have been best friends since meeting at the university in Ferrara; when Esti gives birth to the adorable Theo, they become as close as sisters.

In one week, Maude will be dead. At least, that's what she wants everyone to think. After years of research, Maude has decided to fake her own death. She's figured out the how, the when, the where, and who will help her unsuspectingly. The why is complex: revenge, partly. Her terrible parents deserve this. But there's also 'l'appel du vide,' the call of the void, that beckons her toward a new life where she will be tied to no one, free and adrift. Then Frankie, a stepcousin she barely knows, figures out what she's plotting, and the plan seems like it's ruined. Except Frankie doesn't want to rat her out. Frankie wants in. The girls vault into the unknown, risking everything for a new and limitless life. But there are some things you can never run away from. What if the poison is not in the soil, but in the roots? This pulse-pounding thriller offers a nuanced exploration of identity, freedom, and falling in love while your world falls apart.",

The newest members of their woodland world, they\u2019re curious about everything. What is swimming? Why does mother speak French as she makes pancakes? What does father scrawl in his notebook? Do animals live in the sea? Why do grownups eat smelly cheese? How do we get better when we're sick? What happens when we die? As they start to grow up, every day is filled with another adventure as they explore the peculiar characters that surround them in the forest. Home is always waiting for them, filled with the clacking of father\u2019s typewriter, the sound of mother playing her upright bass, and the smells of quince jam and medicinal moss brews. During their adventures outside the home, they learn that the world is sometimes scarier, stranger and more dangerous than it seemed from the pocket of their father\u2019s coat. Each new encounter leaves Purr and Craw a little braver and wiser and with a few extra friends. Beautifully illustrated with scenes of mischief and discovery by Marjana Prohasko, Who Will Make the Snow? reminds us that the world is always larger and more wonderful than we can see from our own corner of the woods.",

With selections from a stellar assortment of critics including Walter Burkert, Terry Eagleton, Michel Foucault, Ren\u00e9 Girard, and Jean-Pierre Vernant, this book reopens the Oedipus case and lets readers judge for themselves. The Greek word for tragedy means \u201cgoat song.\u201d Is Oedipus the goat? Helene Peet Foley calls him \u201cthe kind of leader a democracy would both love and desire to ostracize.\u201d The Oedipus Casebook readings weigh the evidence against Oedipus, place the play in the context of Greek scapegoat rites, and explore the origins of tragedy in the festival of Dionysus. This unique critical edition includes a new translation of the play by distinguished classics scholar Wm. Blake Tyrrell and the authoritative Greek text established by H. Lloyd-Jones and N. G. Wilson.",

        "description":"The first book-length inquiry into the twisted romantic ballad, giving a sense of both its history and contemporary currency. Titled after Soft Cell's version of the original 1965 Gloria Jones track, Tainted Love is the first book-length inquiry into the subject of the twisted romantic ballad, giving a sense of both its history and contemporary currency. Sometimes extreme, this twist to the conventional romantic ballad spans across gender and generational boundaries to subvert our understanding of both the genre\u2019s function and its behavior. Each chapter of Tainted Love takes a deep dive into a single twisted ballad, examining both its inner workings\u2014lyrics, melody, and vocal approach\u2014and its broader cultural resonance. Featuring an analysis of songs by Kendrick Lamar, Nina Simone, Roxy Music, Joni Mitchell, The Velvet Underground, Frank Sinatra, Soft Cell, Paul McCartney, Charlotte & Serge Gainsbourg, PJ Harvey & Nick Cave, and Little Simz, this book turns on the question: What compels songwriters to compose\u2014and us to listen to\u2014these warped songs?",

Although directed at those seeking to use the healing arts from a purely Pagan perspective, it will be useful to any who are interested in complementary therapies. Written with this in mind, The Healing Craft is both academic and practical, combining chapters on the necessary information required to be a healer (e.g. chapters on the physical and spiritual body) with several chapters designed to increase the reader's skills in several different healing techniques. All the chapters bring together both the orthodox medical viewpoint with that of the complementary therapist.Included within the book are chapters on Spiritual Healing, Massage and Aromatherapy, Shamanistic and Magical Practices, Counselling (with Tarot and Past Life Regression) plus a chapter on Last Rites. Obviously it is impossible to do justice to many of these subjects in a single chapter, so they have been written to!guide the reader to what they will need to learno heal others effectively, while offering basic practical skills. This makes The Healing Craft an invaluable guide to those seeking to practice healing from a holistic pagan viewpoint.",

Guiding us through the strange and fascinating workings of the subatomic realm to create a new model of human consciousness, the author addresses enduring philosophical questions. Does the new physics provide a basis by which our consciousness might continue beyond death? How does the material world (for instance, ugly inner cities) impinge upon our sense of self? Is there a subatomic wellspring from which our creativity, our empathy with others, and our feelings of unity with the inanimate world originate? Most important, Zohar shows how the vitality of the new physics combats the alienation and fragmentation of twentieth-century life, and replaces it with a model of reality in which the universe itself may possess a type of consciousness, of which human consciousness is one expression.",

How do we prepare them for work and life in an era of globalization, volatility, and uncertainty? Empowering Global Citizens offers educators and parents compelling answers to those questions. This book presents The World Course, a curriculum on global citizenship education designed to equip students with the competencies they need to thrive and contribute to sustainable development in an era of globalization. Drawing on curriculum mapping this book offers a coherent and rigorous set of instructional units to support deep learning of twenty-first-century competencies that develop agency, imagination, confidence, and the skills to navigate the complexity of our times. Drawing on a rich conceptual framework of global education, The World Course scaffolds the development of global competency drawing on project-based learning and other pedagogies that support personalization. The course expands children's horizons, helping them understand the world in which they live in all its complexity from kindergarten to high school. This is done through learning activities at the zone for proximal development for each age group, with activities that foster student agency and a growth mindset.",

She didn't know that he liked it rough.More than rough. He liked to dominate. To punish. To degrade. It was the only way that the black hole in his soul wouldn't swallow him up. He would push her a little too far, and she would run. They all ran, eventually.But that's not what happened... when he put his hands around her throat and squeezed, Harper moaned. When he told her to stay away, she didn't listen, misbehaving until she got spanked. When he took out the handcuffs, there was excitement in her eyes, mixed with a little fear.The doe-eyed redhead liked it. More than that, she wanted it.

        "description":"ABOUT THE BOOK In this monograph the author relates findings from more than 30 years of experiences and observations with Bufo alvarius and 5-methoxy-dimethyltryptamine, in various user groups and individuals, both in the US and in Europe. The term underground is used in referring to the explorations with these substances, in the sense that they were hidden - out of respect for the restrictions and prohibitions of mainstream culture. These are ethnographic field reports, first-hand observations from an underground sub-culture, accompanied by the experiences of a selected number of participant-observers. It is important to recognize that in research with these and other so-called psychedelic or entheogenic substances, one cannot limit the observations and reflections solely to their physical and psychological effects. As most of the people cited here emphasize, the experiences with these substances at times can go far beyond their physical and psychological effects into the deepest and highest dimensions of our existence, both the cosmic and the spiritual. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Ralph Metzner, Ph.D., received his undergraduate degree at Oxford University and his doctorate in clinical psychology at Harvard University, where he was also the recipient of an NIMH Post-doctoral Fellowship in psychopharmacology at the Harvard Medical School. He collaborated with Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert in the studies of psychedelic drugs and co-authored The Psychedelic Experience. He is a psychotherapist and Professor Emeritus at the California Institute of Integral Studies, where he taught for 30 years. He has a life-long interest in the many different realms of consciousness and its modifications. He is the author of The Well of Remembrance, The Unfolding Self, Green Psychology, Birth of a Psychedelic Culture (with Ram Dass); editor of two collections of essays on ayahuasca and on psilocybe mushrooms; and author of a new series of seven books on The Ecology of Consciousness.",

Excellent representation of the hero. Jonas remains hot y\u2019all. Great composition. Attractive and eye-catching title work. Five lick worthy stars for sure! <br \/><br \/>Oh, good gravy was this book good. The best of the series so far (IMO). The writing was fantastic. The pace was perfect. The sex scenes were smokin\u2019. It had the perfect blend of romance and action. It had humor. No OW\/OM drama. No angst or drama (couple wise). Fantastic secondary characters. I REALLY hope Matthias\u2019s book is up next. Two extremely likable main characters. A badass Nonna. All wrapped up in a kick-ass ending.<br \/><br \/> <br \/><br \/>Not much left to say really. I am loving this series and cannot wait to see what these authors have up their collective sleeves next. Two HUGE thumbs up from yours truly. P.S. Authors, if you are reading this, I would LOVE to put a request in for IAN to get his own book. Pretty please!! With sugar on top!<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>",

Computer-Assisted Theory Building re-orients the way many social scientists build and work with theories -- and it will prove of value to all practising social science theorists. Because verbal formulations are insufficiently specific and mathematical formulations often too restrictive, the author proposes a new formal language as a middle way, advocating computer simulation models to allow the formulation of more dynamic theories.",

In Typographic Systems, Kim Elam, author of our bestselling books, Geometry of Design and Grid Systems, explores eight major structural frameworks beyond the grid including random, radial, modular, and bilateral systems. By taking the reader through exercises, student work, and professional examples, Elam offers a broad range of design solutions. \r\nOnce essential visual organization systems are understood the designer can fluidly organize words or images within a structure, combination of structures, or a variation of a structure. With clarity and substance, each system from the structured axis to the nonhierarchical radial array is explained and explored so that the reader comes away with a better understanding of these intricate complex arrangements. Typographic Systems is the seventh title in our bestselling Design Briefs series, which has sold more than 100,000 copies worldwide.",

        "description":"In The Tyranny of Human Rights: From Jacobinism to the United Nations Bolton examines the manner by which \"Enlightenment\" doctrines shaped liberalism and the bloody progenies of Jacobinism and Bolshevism. Bolton demonstrates that the inevitable consequences of these doctrines being predicated on the fallacy of universal equality is the need for increasingly draconian laws, pervasive indoctrination, and, where these are insufficient, \"color revolution\" and war. Like the Jacobin doctrine of \"liberty, equality, fraternity,\" these measures, undertaken in the name of \"human rights,\" \"equality,\" and \"social justice,\" are largely directed toward the destruction of European peoples. The ultimate aim behind the humanitarian facade is a world state where people, resources, technology, and capital can be moved about without any hindrance from nation states, races, cultures, and even families. Extensively sourced, with forewords by Dr. Tomislav Sunic and Prof. Edward Dutton, Antelope Hill Publishing is proud to present The Tyranny of Human Rights: From Jacobinism to the United Nations by renowned author Kerry R. Bolton. This latest contribution by Bolton is a vital tool in understanding the nefarious machine of international human rights.",

OK composition and interesting title work. <br \/><br \/>To start with I am going to admit that I am in a bit of a mood funk today. And I am guessing that played a big part in how nitpicky I was being while reading this one. Pushing that aside I will say that I did enjoy it overall.<br \/><br \/>The writing was good. The pace was excellent and I never felt the need to skim. There was some OW drama that was pointless (IMO) since it didn\u2019t cause any issues. I am SO over ridiculous cartoon villain like behavior from OW in these books. Especially in a case like this where it didn\u2019t cause a problem at all and was wrapped up with very little fanfare. There was a nice array of secondary characters as well. Although the mother felt a bit like an afterthought and I would have liked to have seen more involvement in the story from her character. <br \/><br \/> <br \/><br \/>Olivia was a sweet heroine. I don\u2019t have a lot to say about her. I liked her personality. I do wish she would have shown more backbone at times instead of settling when it came to how she thought Nico felt about her. Nico, on the other hand, I had a love\/hate relationship with. For the first 40% of the book his constant inner thoughts about using her and sending her back, not to mention his hot\/cold routine grated on my nerves. The first couple times he had sex with the heroine felt cold to me. Especially the one in the dressing room. I did warm up to him as the book went on, but I still ended up being annoyed at his inability to admit he loved her right up until the book was almost finished. The whole Valentine Day thing pissed me off immensely, and I wanted Olivia to take a stand and decide she deserved more than a guy who couldn\u2019t love her. <br \/><br \/>But like I said, even with the things that annoyed me I still got sucked into the story and ended up enjoying it. So two thumbs up from yours truly. <br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>",

Fest tells and interprets the extraordinary story of a man\u2019s and nation\u2019s rise from impotence to absolute power, as Germany and Hitler, from shared premises, entered into their covenant. He shows Hitler exploiting the resentments of the shaken, post\u2013World War I social order and seeing through all that was hollow behind the appearance of power, at home and abroad. Fest reveals the singularly penetrating politician, hypnotizing Germans and outsiders alike with the scope of his projects and the theatricality of their presentation. Perhaps most importantly, he also brilliantly uncovers the destructive personality that aimed for and achieved devastation on an unprecedented scale. As history and biography, this is a towering achievement, a compelling story told in a way only a German could tell it: \u201cdispassionately, but from the inside\u201d (Time).",

        "description":"Find out how bold actions by visionary leaders can inspire powerful stories that drive culture change. Data indicates that most strategic efforts to change a company's culture fail. So how do companies succeed in this endeavor? A top strategy professor and two highly successful CEOs found that, in companies that had successfully changed their culture, leaders had taken dramatic actions that embodied the new cultural values. These actions inspired stories that became company legends, repeated in every department and handed on to new employees. Through compiling and analyzing 150 stories from business leaders who have achieved change, they identified 6 attributes that every successful culture change story has in common: 1. The actions that build these stories are authentic 2. These stories \"star\" the leader 3. They signal a clean break with the past, and a clear path to the future 4. They appeal to employee heads and hearts 5. They're often theatrical or dramatic 6. They're told, and re-told, throughout the organization With extensive and inspiring examples of stories containing these attributes, the authors illustrate how readers can harness the power of stories within their company in order to change or create a winning culture to align with any strategy.",

One hundred and fifty years from now, in a world where Africa is the dominant technological and economic power, and where crime, war, disease and poverty have been banished to history, Geoffrey Akinya wants only one thing: to be left in peace, so that he can continue his studies into the elephants of the Amboseli basin. But Geoffrey's family, the vast Akinya business empire, has other plans. After the death of Eunice, Geoffrey's grandmother, erstwhile space explorer and entrepreneur, something awkward has come to light on the Moon, and Geoffrey is tasked - well, blackmailed, really - to go up there and make sure the family's name stays suitably unblemished. But little does Geoffrey realise - or anyone else in the family, for that matter - what he's about to unravel. Eunice's ashes have already have been scattered in sight of Kilimanjaro. But the secrets she died with are about to come back out into the open, and they could change everything. Or shatter this near-utopia into shards ...",

However, don't consider this book to be a pure science fiction and entertainment. This book is built on Illuminati Secret Knowledge and secret CIA reports of world events of 2035 and 2041 that no one except two Presidents and a few generals ever saw. Also the book is based on the serious scientific theories such as retro-causality when future is affecting the past as well as the accounts of people who claim that they saw the future: from Nostradamus and Baba Vanga to the accounts of so called modern time travelers. We researched dozens of them and found a couple of them to be credible because they are keep repeating the same things: some from the distant past while others are from the far future, so don't be surprised if you live though World War Three, the Great American Earthquake and Earth's orbit change till 2041 to see how accurately this book predicted other future events that seems insane today.",

He\u2019s the agency\u2019s hottest new star, or at least he wants his coworker crush to think so. But while he\u2019s busy drooling over his future corner office, the walls crumble around him. When his job lets him go, he can\u2019t let go of his job. Unfortunately, one former colleague can\u2019t let him go either: Robert \u201cMoon\u201d McCloone, a skeezy on-the-rise exec better suited to a frat house than a boardroom. Seth tries to forget Moon and rediscover his spiritual self; he studies Kabbalah with an Orthodox rabbi by day while popping illegal prescription pills by night. But with each misstep, Seth strays farther from salvation\u2014though he might get there, if he could only get out of his own way. In his debut novel, Purkert incisively peels back the layers of the male ego, revealing what\u2019s rotten and what might be redeemed. Brimming with wit, irreverence, and soul-searching, The Men Can\u2019t Be Saved is a startlingly original examination of work, sex, addiction, religion, branding, and ourselves.",

Enquiring minds want to know!<br \/><br \/> <br \/><br \/>Hopefully, there will be more books coming in this series, and they will be full-length ones. Two thumbs up from yours truly. <br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>",

With the attention to detail of a historian and the story-telling ability of a novelist, New York Times science writer George Johnson celebrates these groundbreaking experiments and re-creates a time when the world seemed filled with mysterious forces and scientists were in awe of light, electricity, and the human body. Here, we see Galileo staring down gravity, Newton breaking apart light, and Pavlov studying his now famous dogs. This is science in its most creative, hands-on form, when ingenuity of the mind is the most useful tool in the lab and the rewards of a well-considered experiment are on elegant display.From the Trade Paperback edition.",

Then I meet Keynes, a stranger from the city who\u2019s everything I\u2019m not: sharp-tongued, sophisticated, beautiful. Free. For a few precious moments in a dark alleyway, he\u2019s also mine, hot and sweet under the stars\u2026 until he crushes me like dirt beneath his designer boot. When the prettiest man I\u2019ve ever hated shows up at my job the next day, I\u2019m not sure if I want to strangle him or drag him into bed. Actually\u2014I think I want both. But Keynes isn\u2019t here for the likes of me: he makes that painfully clear. With everyone else at work, he\u2019s all gorgeous, glittering charm\u2014but when I get too close, he turns vicious. And yet, I can\u2019t stay away. Because there\u2019s something about this ice king that sets me on fire, a secret vulnerability that makes my chest ache. I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to sneak past his walls and see the real man again. The last thing I expect is for that man to ruin me. Work for It is 80,000 words of hot, angst-filled, M\/M romance featuring a cynical city boy, a gruff, soft-hearted farmer, and a guaranteed happy-ever-after. No cheating, no cliff-hangers, just love. (Eventually.) This story is a spin-off set in the Just for Him world, taking place after the last book in that series.

Very good representation though, from the black gay guy with mental health problems that he works through in the book.<\/p>",

This is the Thebes that Jocasta has known her entire life, a city ruled by a king--her husband-to-be. Jocasta struggles through this miserable marriage until she is unexpectedly widowed--now free to choose her next husband, she selects the handsome, youthful Oedipus. When whispers emerge of an unbearable scandal, the very society that once lent Jocasta its support seems determined to destroy her. Ismene is a girl in mourning, longing for the golden days of her youth--days spent lolling in the courtyard garden, reading and reveling in her parents' happiness and love. Now she is an orphan, and the target of a murder plot, attacked within the very walls of the palace. As the deadly political competition swirls around her, she must uncover the root of the plot - and reveal the truth of the curse that has consumed her family. The novel is based on Oedipus Tyrannus and Antigone , two of Classical Greece's most compelling tragedies. Told in intersecting narratives, this feminist reimagining of Sophocles' classic plays brings life and voice to the women who were too often forced to the background of their own stories. It is compulsively entertaining fiction that recasts these familiar stories for the twenty-first century reader.",

It\u2019s an almost perfect cover, but we all know by now how annoyed I get when the author\u2019s name is bigger than the actual title of the book. So it loses a star for that! <br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>This book was entirely different than what you usually expect from this author and I quite enjoyed it. Don\u2019t go into this expecting romance or a happily ever after. This story is a dark thriller about an internet date that goes very wrong. I thought it was well written and well paced and the characters interesting. It even had a nice little twist at the end. I\u2019m glad the author decided to let this one out of her head and give it a voice.<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>",

        "description":"The Hunting For Bears marriage data collection as of about 1980, covering 16 states, was bundled with Family Tree Maker(c) and sold in the tens of thousands and was crucial in making FTM(c) the most popular genealogical software in the world.\r\n\r\nThe same collection was included in Ancestry's(c) initial data searches, playing a significant role in its rise to the world's premier on line genealogy data search engine. \r\n\r\nThat was the 1980 collection, the 2010 collection dwarfs it in comparison. This book is part of that 2010 collection. It is maintained in a data base structure to provide the highest information density. Each marriage is contained in one line. Each party in the union is included in the alphabetical listing. Using the records in a database format and listing both participants in the alphabetical sort was so unique in 1960 that the U.S. Government has granted Hunting For Bears a (c)copyright on the presentation in both electronic and print format.\r\n\r\nWhen available, record location information such as county book and page number may be included as well as age, birth or death dates, race, gender and information about prior marriages. \r\n\r\nSeveral things we are considering in the immediate future are; e_books to buy, loan or free downloads, books available through instant publication, and books on line.\r\n\r\nOh, the name and logo, Russell, as Nick was called in his youth, loved puns. The newspaper genealogy column that he began writing in 1951, Hunting Your Forebears, quickly became Hunting For Bears and the bear and hunter logo was created.",

        "publicationYear":2019,
        "description":"A critical examination of the history of US-Palestinian relations The United States has invested billions of dollars and countless diplomatic hours in the pursuit of Israeli-Palestinian peace and a two-state solution. Yet American attempts to broker an end to the conflict have repeatedly come up short. At the center of these failures lay two critical factors: Israeli power and Palestinian politics. While both Israelis and Palestinians undoubtedly share much of the blame, one also cannot escape the role of the United States, as the sole mediator in the process, in these repeated failures. American peacemaking efforts ultimately ran aground as a result of Washington's unwillingness to confront Israel's ever-deepening occupation or to come to grips with the realities of internal Palestinian politics. In particular, the book looks at the interplay between the U.S.-led peace process and internal Palestinian politics--namely, how a badly flawed peace process helped to weaken Palestinian leaders and institutions and how an increasingly dysfunctional Palestinian leadership, in turn, hindered prospects for a diplomatic resolution. Thus, while the peace process was not necessarily doomed to fail, Washington's management of the process, with its built-in blind spot to Israeli power and Palestinian politics, made failure far more likely than a negotiated breakthrough. Shaped by the pressures of American domestic politics and the special relationship with Israel, Washington's distinctive \"blind spot\" to Israeli power and Palestinian politics has deep historical roots, dating back to the 1917 Balfour Declaration and the British Mandate. The size of the blind spot has varied over the years and from one administration to another, but it is always present.",

        "description":"Who gets to choose? When a young woman emerges from a lengthy coma-like state she must face the decisions that were made about her body--without her consent--in this powerful novel of reclamation and hope. Twenty-one-year-old Mallie Williams--scrappy, headstrong, and wise beyond her years--has just landed on her feet following a tumultuous youth when the unthinkable happens: she is violently assaulted. The crime leaves her comatose, surrounded by friends and family who are hoping against hopes for a full recovery. But soon Mallie's small community finds themselves divided. The rape has left Mallie pregnant, and while some friends are convinced that she would never keep the pregnancy, others are sure that a baby would be the only good thing to come out of all of this pain. Who gets to decide? How much power, in the end, do we have over our own bodies? Mallie, her family, and her town find themselves at the center of a media storm, confronting questions nobody should have to face. And when Mallieemerges from the fog, what will she think of the choices that were made on her behalf? The Opposite of Fate is an intense and moving exploration of the decisions we make--and don't make--that forever change the course of our lives.",
