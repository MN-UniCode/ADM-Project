        "description":"--Where and what is Ireland? --What are the identities of the people of Ireland? --How has European Union membership shaped Irish people's lives and interests? --How global is local Ireland? This book argues that such questions can be answered only by understanding everyday aspects of Irish culture and identity. Such understanding is achieved by paying close attention to what people in Ireland themselves say about the radical changes in their lives in the context of wider global transformation. As notions of sex, religion, and politics are radically reworked in an Ireland being re-imagined in ways inconceivable just a generation ago, anthropologists have been at the forefront of recording the results. The first comprehensive book-length introduction to anthropological research on the island as a whole, The Anthropology of Ireland considers the changing place in a changing Ireland of religion, sex, sport, race, dance, young people, the Travellers, St Patrick's Day and much more.",

        "publicationYear":2007,
        "description":"After scrounging a meal in their remote mountain holiday shack in British Columbia, James and Alisa start to think about the journeys that the foods they eat have taken around the world and the environmental cost of all those food miles. (North America: food travels an average of 1500-3000 miles from farm to plate and the distances are increasing.) They decide to eat only food grown in a 100-mile radius of their Vancouver home for one year. They know there are certain staples and favourites they'll have to do without, but they gear themselves for the challenge. Taking alternate chapters through the book Alisa and James each tell the story of their year. Each chapter has a recipe, details of the foods they sourced, how they cooked them as well as the experiences of hunting out the foods and the people that grew them. Although many the foods that they can and can't source are quite different from those available and not available to a person in Melbourne (which would be different for someone in Sydney, Perth or Auckland . . . ) the stories they tell of searching out foods from local growers, or cooking with ingredients they are unfamiliar with (but that their grandmothers have recipes for), the cravings they have for certain foods, and the lengths they go to for a slice of bread (separating mouse poo from grains of wheat, grain by grain with a credit card) are interesting, endearing and often humorous. But most of all The 100 Mile Diet is a story of people connecting with their environment-the land and the people.",

Former ship's surgeon Gabriel Taverner is attempting to re-establish himself as a country physician in rural Devon. But it's not easy to gain the locals' trust, and a series of disturbing incidents, increasing in menace and intensity, convinces him that at least one person does not welcome his presence. Called out to examine a partially decomposed body found beside the river, Gabriel discovers that he has a personal connection to the dead man. Teaming up with Coroner Theophilus Davey to find out how the man died, Gabriel uncovers some darker aspects of the lucrative silk trade which operates from nearby Plymouth. The more he finds out, the more frighteningly apparent it becomes that the people closest to him have been keeping dangerous secrets.",
